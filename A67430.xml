            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Our firſt reformers were great Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for liberty of Conſcience, as <hi>Wicliffe</hi> in his remonſtration to the Parliament: the Albigenſis to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh and twelfth of <hi>France.

               <p>While Popery was prevalent in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Pope being then reputed Vicar of Chriſt in ſpiritual things, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo much liberty was given, that no man ſuffered death for oppoſing his dictates in Religion: and then in the 2. of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, a Statute being made againſt the Lollards, the Commons petitioned the King, it might be repealed, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Commons it was then in part repealed in <hi>Stat. Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>A wiſe Emperor told <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>France,</hi> there was no greater ſin then to force mens conſciences, for ſuch as think to Command them, ſuppoſing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56315:8"/> to win heaven, do often looſe what they poſſeſs on earth. King <hi>James</hi> in his ſpeech to the Parliment, ſaith that it is a ſure Rule in Divinity, that God never planted the Church by violence or Bloodſhed. Much leſs ſaith the wiſe Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> ought the Sword to be put in the peoples hands to perſecute, nouriſh ſedition, authorize conſpiracies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that is but to daſh the firſt table a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond, and to Conſider men as Chriſtians, as we forget they are men.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Romans in Caſe of Religion, were very tender and Cautious: for when <hi>Cato</hi> was Conſul and it ſeemed neceſſary to the Senate to ſuppreſs with violence, the diſordered Ceremonies of the Bacchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, brought in by a ſtrange Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City; he withſtood that ſentence, alleging there was nothing ſo apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men as Religion, which always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a ſhew of Divinity; and for that Cauſe it behooved to be very wary in Chaſtiſing the profeſſors thereof, leaſt any indignation ſhould enter into the peoples minds that ſomewhat was derogated from the Majeſty of God.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56315:9"/>
               <p>Others More freely, have not ſpared to place Religion (I mean that which is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly Zealous) amongſt the kind of frenzies, which cannot be cured other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by time given to divert and qualify the humour of the conceit. Whence <hi>Levia</hi> ſaid to <hi>Auguſtus, Viſne Muliebre Concilium?</hi> Let ſeverity ſleep a while, and try what what alteration the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donning of <hi>Cinna</hi> may procure. The Emperor hearkned to her Counſel, and thereby found his enemies mouths ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and their Malice abated. A ſoft gale of wind oft allaies a great ſtorm, the warm Sun will prevail more with the traveller, then cold and boiſterous winds. The Goats blood will break the Adamant, which the hardeſt hammers cannot do: Chronical diſeaſes are not cured by phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and motion, but by time and reſt. It fals out many times that the remedy is worſe then the diſeaſe, and while we go about to cure the State, we kill it, and inſtead of purging out the peccant humour of the body politick, we caſt it into a <hi>Calenture</hi> or burning feaver. This was not unknown to that wiſe and good Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who could not be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56315:9"/> perſwaded to extirpate or uſe violent courſes againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> knowing how dangerous it would prove to the ſtate if the quietneſs thereof ſhould be diſturbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet when he beheld the act of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> that could endure the ſacrificing of his own daughter, exclaimed <hi>tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum?</hi> what would he have ſaid if he had known and ſeen the Chriſtian Bloodſhed and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in Religion in theſe times? he would have been ten times more Epicure then he was.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Sabbacus</hi> a Heathen King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> who being by dreams admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that he could not poſſeſs himſelf of the Kingdom, but by the ſlaying of the Prieſts: he choſe rather to lay aſide the Claim; and to refer the government to twelve wiſe men; How much more will it become Chriſtians not to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion upon the Carkaſſes, ſpoils and ruins of their diſtreſſed neighbors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and fellow Subjects?</p>
               <p>It hath been an ancient aphoriſm of State and Wiſdome of the greateſt Princes, <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire raro,</hi> it was aſcribed to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> as a title of honour, <hi>nunquam Civilem ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem

               <p>The Kingdome of Chriſt is not carried on after the faſhion of this World, with arms and engines of War, to be erected on the bones and Sepulchres of our Brethren and Fathers. The Throne of Chriſt is not ſupported as <hi>Solomons,</hi> on both ſides with Lyons and Tygres, Bears and Wolves; inſtead of Lambs and Doves, as if we ſhould change our meek, patient, crucified <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and had got ſome Muzzian a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan God of Forces, who is to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Buff Coats and Armour. It was a great blaſqhemy when the Devil ſaid, I will aſcend and be like to the higheſt; but it is a greater blaſphemy to perſonate God &amp; to bring him, ſaying, I will deſcend to be like the Prince of Darkneſs with furies and perſecutions: nay, what is worſe to make the Cauſe of Religion (as is proved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience this laſt Century) deſcend to the Cruel and inhumane murthering of Princes, butchering of the People, rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56315:10"/> of Conſciences, by Oaths and Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; ſurely this is to bring down the Holy Ghoſt inſtead of likeneſs of a Dove into the ſhape of a Vulture or Raven, and to ſet out for the Barque of a Chriſtian Church, a Flag of a Barque of Pirats and Aſſaſinates, or to bring in an <hi>armatum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium,</hi> Chriſtian Religion in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Armour; and Chriſt marching like <hi>Alexander, Hannibal</hi> or <hi>Caeſar:</hi> it is hard to pick out Letters of Mart, from the Goſpel, or to have any Commiſſion to kill or ſlay Jeſus Chriſt in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>Whence a learned divine of our Engliſh Church ſaith, it is a ſqualid reformation, that is beſmeared with the blood of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it is againſt the honour, order, unity and majeſty of a reformed Church to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and to be like thoſe <hi>canes ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrales,</hi> violating the bones and aſhes of the dead.</p>
               <p>Perſecution ſetteth a man as far from a true Chriſtian temper, as burning Feavers do from natural heat and health, when once a male contented member is grieved then the reſt of the body is ſenſible and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly arm for oppoſition: all cry pity any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56315:11"/> ſhould ſuffer for their conſcience, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſay among themſelves <hi>ſors hodierna mihi, Cras erit illa tibi,</hi> there being neceſſary connexion between Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and that which is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and, who would diveſt any of their ſpiritual, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm them with juſt Cauſes of looſing their <hi>Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of man however in hot blood, it be thirſty of revenge, yet in a cooler temper it hath a kind of <hi>nauſea</hi> or diſtaſte of taking the lives even of the moſt <hi>Nocent</hi> inſomuch that in Aſſizes or Seſſions an Offender can hardly be condemned, whom the pity of many will not after a ſort excuſe, with laying of impoſitions on the Judge, part on the Jury, and much on the accuſers. Hence the name of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant or <hi>Purſuivant</hi> is odious and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner eſteemed no better then an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, and if ſuch as are tender of their reputations be very ſcrupulous perſonally to arreſt men for civil actions of debt, they will be more unwilling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of drawing their Bodies to the Rack and Gallows, eſpecially when any colour of Religion is pretended in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

               <p>In Counſels concerning Religion that adviſe of the Apoſtle ſhould be prefixed, <hi>ira hominis non implet juſtitiam,</hi> we are to conſider we deal with men and not with beaſts, man is to be treated humanly, and a Chriſtian, chriſtianly, with all reaſon and charity; and of tender Conſciences ought to be had a tender reſpect, man is ſenſible of gentleneſs, &amp; may be obliged to quietneſs, by <hi>humanity.</hi> Whereas if you take violent courſes, and fight againſt the errors of the times with priſons, dungeons, fetters, oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will make men the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hypocrites and be occaſion of inteſtine diviſion and bloodſhed: experience can ſpeak ſomewhat in this behalf, which hath evidently deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hence one of our late Divines ſaith, it is ſufficiently known what the immoderation of a prepoſterous zeal, male contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ambition and force, hath both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinated, and perpetrated to the deſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on well nigh deſtruction of Church and State. The impudence and imprudence of inconſiderable raſh ſpirits, in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56315:12"/> paſſions, and pretences for the Goſpel hath cauſed the ſlaughter of 200000 in <hi>Germany,</hi> hath cauſed, at leaſt occaſioned moſt of the wars, devaſtations, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the great alterations, tumults &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in moſt places of Chriſtiandom, &amp; our late Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> ſaith, impoſitions on mens Conſciences and Judgments in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, to tye them by penal and coercive Statutes (which like Perſian ſheep) carry tails of incurious mulcts after them, that are heavier then their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>To come with ſwords to put Religion into our heads with main force, is like the watering of Plants with ſalt ſtreams, or the lighting of a Candle with gun-powder. Never was Chriſtian Religion planted or propagated by wars, by the civil and martial Sword; for God is not pleaſed with hypocrital and unwilling worſhippers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereto by outward violence; nor are Chriſtian Societies bettered by ſuch force, but oft-times the contrary. Too much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity maketh men deſperate &amp; ſheweth a will to oppreſs the offendor, rather then cure the offence, and nothing ſheweth more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that authority inclineth to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>Unchriſtian perſecution like a violent <hi>Chryſis,</hi> more frequently taketh away the Patient, then Contributes to his recovery! nouriſheth a wrathful devouring ſpirit one againſt another, makes us tranſgreſſors of that Royal law, which forbids us to do that one to another, we would not have them do to us, were we in their condition: and by this rule whoſoever is not againſt the cruelty of perſecution, hath nothing to ſay againſt juſtice, of his being a ſlave; for what meaſure he would mete unto others, he deſerves himſelf.</p>
               <p>If to hate our brother is murder, as he is man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. ſure not only to hate, but even for Religion ſake to kill our brother a Chriſtian, and to be deſtroyers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are rather <hi>deicides,</hi> then <hi>homicides!</hi> and if nothing can have more of Chriſtian then <hi>Charity,</hi> nothing can have more of <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> then ſuch uncharitableneſs, which many nouriſhing for zeal, miſtake a Cockatrice for a Dove, and fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for a Phenix.</p>

               <p>External force in matter of Faith and Worſhip is repugnant to the nature of Chriſtian Religion, which is <hi>meekneſs;</hi> To the practice, which is <hi>ſuffering;</hi> To the <hi>promotion</hi> of it, go <hi>teach all Nations.</hi> Chriſtian Religion intreats all, compels none.

               <p>It is very unreaſonable to force men to declare or ſwear where their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not fully ſatisfied; to require Faith where they cannot chooſe but doubt, to puniſh them for <hi>diſobedience,</hi> if they go not againſt their conſciences; and to be puniſhed hereafter if they do: For an <hi>erroneous Conſcience</hi> bindeth a man to follow it, according to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all <hi>Religions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perſecution deſtroyeth the noble principle of reaſon, for no man can believe before he underſtands; and no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56315:15"/> man can underſtand before he is taught: for <hi>Faith</hi> in all acts of Religion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Now to believe we muſt firſt will, to will we muſt judge; to judge any thing we muſt underſtand; which cannot be forced. How can the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous diſeaſe of the mind be cured with corporal <hi>catoplaſts?</hi> or mens judgments be convinced of the truth by tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Bodies? the <hi>inflictions</hi> then of external puniſhments for meer mental errors (not wilful) is unreaſonable and inadaequate, for as corporal penalties cannot convince the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> ſo neither can they be <hi>proportionable mulct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Before we can with <hi>juſtice</hi> inflict pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties upon any different <hi>profeſſion,</hi> we ought to uſe all means poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to truth. Arguments to rational creatures as Chriſtians, are to <hi>inſtruct, admoniſh, warn,</hi> and finally to <hi>reject;</hi> to come to them full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their miſery, full of <hi>affection</hi> of their Salvation by reaſonable and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive</hi> motives ſuitable to their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; by ſomethng can reſolve its doubts anſwer its objections, <hi>tenets,</hi> and <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56315:15"/> Whence our firſt work ſhould be to <hi>collect</hi> a Body of <hi>poſitive articles</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained in Scripture and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to <hi>ſalvation</hi> (for its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to pen the form of Faith in the negative) becauſe my believing <hi>Chriſtian</hi> truths makes me a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and not my disbelieving the errors that oppoſe it; elſe he that believes nothing at all would be the beſt Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>We muſt fight againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by lawful ways preſcribed by the Word of God, by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of his mouth, in preaching, inſtructing in <hi>Charity, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, humility,</hi> according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The weapons of Chriſtian warfare are not <hi>Carnal</hi> but <hi>Spiritual, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. For as they were not the warlike <hi>engines</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but the <hi>trumpets</hi> of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> that made the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> to fall down: So it is not the <hi>Canon,</hi> but the <hi>trumpet</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to pull down the walls of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> True Religion was never advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by theſe ways, but propagated by patient ſufferings: the Example of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſo far from perſecuting,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56315:16"/> that he would not revile his <hi>perſecutors;</hi> prayed for them; ſaith, go <hi>teach all nations, &amp;c.</hi> The Text directs Chriſts procedure in teaching, not in devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all wiſe, humble, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Chriſtians ſhould ſo Order their <hi>judgments</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> if at any time they are forced to declare them; they muſt above all things take heed they nouriſh not, nor diſcover any unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>fewds, antipathies, diſtances</hi> againſt others, after the rule of thoſe <hi>paſſions,</hi> which were the common ſource of Schiſm and Hereſies. The free, meek, and ſolid piety feeds it ſelf on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion, without picking quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels at the ſhell; free from the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and hypochondriacal <hi>Zeal</hi> of ſome who pretend to advance the Kingdom of Chriſt by cutting the throats of his Diſciples, and <hi>cementing</hi> his temples with blood, inſtead of the <hi>Cement</hi> of charity.</p>

               <p>It is obſerved by all lookers into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that Chriſtian Religion ſtill got ground in the world, not by perſecuting

               <p>It hath been likewiſe obſerved as a ſhuffling <hi>hypocritical diſtinction</hi> of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56315:22"/> (invented to deceive the innocent) pretending none are executed or ſuffer for Religion or Conſcience, but for Treaſon; or offending the Laws. Who doth not ſee but by this rule thoſe Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tyrants <hi>Nero, Diocleſian, Maximine, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be conſcientious, becauſe they judged according to the Law? and thoſe glorious Martyrs muſt be counted Traitors? nay even the curſed Jews who crucified Chriſt alledged the ſelf-ſame reaſon; we have a Law and by our Law he ought to die, <hi>John</hi> 19. 7.</p>
               <p>Treaſon muſt alwaies be ſome action or intention diſcovered prejudicial to the Soveraign or State: not an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Profeſſion of Religion. For this reaſon Sir <hi>John Old-Caſtle</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, for his <hi>Treaſon</hi> was condemned in one Court, and for his Hereſie, in another. So were <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. And therefore alſo it is by the ſtatute provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 22 and 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that if a Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, he is actually diſcharged of all imputation of treaſon; no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding can lye againſt him.</p>
               <p>If Prieſt-hood be no treaſon, a Prieſt

'Tis the bleſſing and comfort of peace and unity in the Church, of plenty and tranquillity in the Common-wealth; of plain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Conſcience, and of plenary contentation to all ſorts and conditions of rational men. Nothing can be eaſie, ſweet, and ſafe, in our lives, Religion, Conſciences, or liberties to God or man without it: without it we be tedious to our ſelves and troubleſome one to another.</p>
               <p>This virtue is not a little illuſtrated by its contrary oppoſit, Perſecution, <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, auſterity, rigidneſs, inexorable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, compulſion,</hi> impoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is an extream vitiouſneſs in perſons, in their judgments, opinions, paſſions, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, pretences, actions, and deſigns:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56315:25"/> of which we have been more <hi>pathetically</hi> ſenſible in the effects, than in the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This medium therefore or middle kind of equity, indulgency or liberty betwixt both extremities aforeſaid, is the moſt juſt and reaſonable unto which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have a right and title too; by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, Death and Reſurrection, who is become ſole Lord over the Soul, unto whom we are to give account only as our proper Judg, in matters purely internal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: for in this the Judicatures of men are not capable to make a clear judgment, or declare certainly who are in the right or wrong.</p>
               <p>This Freedome of Conſcience is of ſo high concern to all (and not only to be enjoyed by the ſtrongeſt party) as well for the Magiſtrates ſake as the Peoples common good; and it conſiſts in the Magiſtrates forbearing to impoſe preſſures and penalties in matters of Faith and Conſcience, leſt they intrude into the Office of Chriſt, to whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſuch actions are only liable.</p>
               <p>The ancient original Fundamental
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56315:26"/> Laws (by which other Laws of leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) are to be regulated were intended as a Defence and Protection to all: providing, one injure not another; and that Common Peace and Safety be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; no other ſubſequent inferiour Law can therefore debar any peaceable Chriſtian, that anſwers the neceſſities of Church and State, Civil, Spiritual and Political) in equal juſtice, and in <hi>foro Conſcientiae</hi> from this priviledge original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to all: For they that are contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to the peace and maintenance of Government, are intitled to a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it, according to the juſt nature of government which conſiſts in a fair and equal retribution. Whence a late Presb. Divine confeſſeth, none ever ſaw any argument yet could clearly evince, why any ſort of men who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a peaceable ſubjection unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, might not in all their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights be protected by it.</p>
               <p>I conceive it therefore moſt clear, both in right reaſon and true Religion: that Governours ought to move in that middle way between tolerating all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and none at all in matters of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56315:26"/> Religion: wherein men are variouſly to be conſidered, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they own and make of Religion: as none are to be tolerated in Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or any that have caſt off all ſenſe of juſtice, order, ſhame and humanity (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of man is more prone to imbibe noxious things then to eject them) ſo true virtuous liberty is not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed; nor any who can give a ſober Chriſtian and rational account for their principles and profeſſion to Church and State. For the Power among Chrſtians ſhould not be a hard and ſharp rock daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently all in pieces that touch, and ſtrike at it in the leaſt kind though never ſo modeſtly.</p>

               <p>The beſt way to convince oppoſers is by inſtructing them in meekneſs in the Spirit of Love, by ſuitable acts of <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency;</hi> for our dear Lord that bought us, will take nothing more kindly at this time from us (ſaith an ingenious Author) as to be pitiful to his Servants, who are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed about your acts in point of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

In point of Chriſtianity we ſhould be <hi>merciful</hi> unto them as our heavenly <hi>Father is merciful, Luke</hi> 6. 36. Mercy is to be preferred before Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

               <p>As nothing is more plain and ſure then that the <hi>tolerating</hi> of all <hi>Sects,</hi> errors and faults, which <hi>conſcience</hi> may pretend for: or of none at all, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtructive of Chriſtian and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man peace, ſociety and ſafety, nor is he well in his wits that holdeth either part <hi>univerſally</hi> or unlimitted (who thinketh all or none to be tolerated) for by the one we ſhould have no government, and by the other in time, by death, <hi>baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> perſecutions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhould have

               <p>But then it may be objected, ſeeing <hi>toleration</hi> muſt have its bounds and limits, and thoſe are almoſt <hi>indiſcoverable, viz.</hi> what points are neceſſary? and what not? what Sects and Opinions tolerable? and what not? and who muſt be the Judge? or elſe we muſt deal partially, and unjuſtly condemn one Sect and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate others?</p>

               <p>The profeſſion of the Creed and thoſe who give ſome ſolid, <hi>ſuccinct</hi> and <hi>apodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi> account directly grounded on Scripture, rightly underſtood, or in right regulated reaſon which is able to bear a <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> of Chriſtian Doctrin and practice (as enumerated afore) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſummary of Belief in <hi>poſitive,</hi> evident, and fundamental points ſuitable to the Apoſtolical Symbol, are conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which require neceſſarily <hi>indulgency</hi> and <hi>toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe regards then, there can be no prevalent objections urged, why a wiſe State may not tolerate (at leaſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56315:30"/> different Religions: when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the publick may be <hi>intangled</hi> or endangered; or rather becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be compelled or <hi>Faith</hi> forced.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56315:31"/> that there may be no breach of Peace and diſturbance in the Government of the State.</p>

               <p>For this reaſon it was that the great Apoſtles treated the Synagogue (whoſe Religion at that time was vacuated) and conſequently void of Truth, with ſo much reſpect and condeſcendency: and that afterwards the moſt primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſed ſo often this <hi>expreſſion;</hi> that the <hi>Synagogue ought to be buried with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

               <p>Whence one of our Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſaith, even by the Law of <hi>Seniority</hi> Catholicks might exſpect ſome favour.

               <p>The firſt poſſeſſion of a man is a good title by the Law of Nature until an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; or the Law of Reaſon (which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56315:42"/> with mankind is to have pre-eminence) diſpoſſeſſes it. The Roman Church had a poſſeſſion <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and the Pope enjoyed <hi>juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> a longer time, than any <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of Princes can pretend to, and ſubmitted to by all our Anceſtors. In Catholick Religion, they ſtand as <hi>defenders,</hi> others as <hi>invaders,</hi> they as <hi>poſſeſſors,</hi> others as <hi>diſſeiſors;</hi> they ſeek to keep what <hi>de jure</hi> they had; <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others what they had not. There is a vaſt difference in theſe two Caſes, to oppoſe by force the introducement of innovations, and to attempt by force the extinguiſhment of an ancient Religion of which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are univerſally in a quiet and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> poſſeſſion. The one drives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of poſſeſſion, the other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains himſelf: the one invades his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours rights, the other defends his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and innovation with ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of right have been oft in ſeveral ages perſecuted by rigour of Laws even by Proteſtants; and the reaſon, is becauſe <hi>innovation</hi> in Religion moſt commonly breeds diſturbance in the Common-wealth.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56315:42"/>
               <p>Natural reaſon teaches that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man is to be condemned much leſs deprived of what he ſtands poſſeſſed, till his cauſe be judiciouſly heard and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced.—Nor ought any man to be Judg in his own Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But penal Laws and <hi>Oaths</hi> made in contempt and <hi>derogation</hi> of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which through all Chriſtendom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with learning <hi>civility</hi> and <hi>loyalty;</hi> whoſe Doctrin amongſt the primitive, greateſt, and moſt <hi>learned ſocieties,</hi> hath been and is avouched; in moſt Nations and Kingdoms allowed; and more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed and permitted: eſtabliſhed by the Laws in which our Predeceſſors were born and continued; wherein all our Progenitors, all the Peers Eccleſiaſt.

               <p>It was ſaid by King <hi>James</hi> one of the moſt learned Princes (not in private, but

               <p>
                  <hi>Primo,</hi> There muſt be <hi>evidence</hi> of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

The beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then of any Religion, is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our deceaſed Predeceſſors and <hi>Anceſtry,</hi> whoſe Faith and Doctrine is freſh in the memories and teſtimonies of the Chriſtian poſterity of the preſent Church. For beſides the Authority of the preſent Church we can have no greater evidence in <hi>foro externo</hi> for the Law of God and Religion; then the teſtimony of precedent ages confirmed with <hi>ſupernatural Signs: v. g.</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Age delivered to the fifteenth, the Roman Faith which now they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; aſſuring them that it was the true ſenſe and Letter of Scripture, which they had learned from the thirteenth age and ſo forward to the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>No reformers can produce one law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs againſt Catholick Religion, and their ſenſe of Scripture; yet the Greateſt Crimes require at leaſt one lawful Witneſs. For what evidence had the firſt Reformers to oppoſe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all former Ages, confirmed with ſo many miracles; and to make Statutes againſt the known practiced Religion at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56315:44"/> leaſt for nine hundred years? Antiquity affords them none, becauſe though in diverſe Ages ſome odd men did teſtifie ſometimes an errour, they were in thoſe very times contradicted by the Church, and declared <hi>impoſtors</hi> and <hi>innovators.</hi> In this preſent Age no Sectaries can be lawful Witneſſes for their own lately modelled Religion, or againſt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Catholick, becauſe their teſtimonies cannot be valid againſt ſo conſtant an univerſal <hi>Tradition</hi> and practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> Its ridiculous and unjuſt in a Judge to pronounce <hi>ſentence</hi> againſt Roman Catholick upon the <hi>evidence</hi> and teſtimony of <hi>Calvin, Luther, &amp;c.</hi> as in open Court to condemn men to forfeit their Eſtates and <hi>ancient inheritances,</hi> upon the word of a mad fellow, that produceth no other evidence to confirm his claim; but <hi>interior motions</hi> of the Spirit, or ſome obſcure Text of Law appliable to all Caſes, and Subjects: for all the Proteſtant evidence is reduced to the private Spirit and the pretended <hi>clearneſs</hi> of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertio,</hi> The <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power ought to be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56315:45"/> but Statutes againſt Catholicks are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt the Law of God and Chriſtian Religion, if we may credit Antiquity, and ſtick to the Faith and practice of the Church, and Princes that went before us; not only in <hi>England</hi> but all other Chriſtian Kingdomes. This way therefore of proceeding is different from all other Nations, and altereth the Stile of natural reaſon, humane nature, and the practice of all Antiquity; and conſequently deſtroyes the foundation of juſtice and form of <hi>Judicature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quarto,</hi> The common temporal <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal</hi> Laws (which <hi>Science</hi> above all others next to <hi>Divinity</hi>) doth confirm and evince unto the underſtanding of an Engliſhman the Truth of Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Foraſmuch as from our firſt Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> which muſt needs be the <hi>origin</hi> and beginning of all Chriſtian Common Laws in <hi>England,</hi> unto the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, all our Princes and People being of one and the ſame Catholick Religion, their Laws muſt needs be preſumed to have been conformed to their ſenſe and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that behalf; and our Lawyers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56315:45"/> to our Laws. So as now to ſee an <hi>Engliſh temporal</hi> Lawyer to impugn the ſaid Catholick Religion by the <hi>antiquity</hi> of the common Laws throughout the times and reigns of the ſaid Kings and Queens, to favour and countenance <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> or any new Opinions, not known before: is as great an abſurdity, novelty and wonder as to ſee a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher brought up in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School, to impugn <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in favour of <hi>Petrus Ramus, Deſcartes</hi> or ſome other new Adverſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> never prejudiced any Nation or State (where it had free paſſage) in the leaſt degree; but hath ever been their ſafety, happineſs, and honour.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Roteſtant <hi>Religion</hi> doth indemnifie us in the Court of Conſcience for <hi>believing</hi> in matters of Religion according to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our own <hi>private judgment;</hi> or rather doth oblige us to do it. For as Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> a learned Proteſtant ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">If it be not lawful for every one to be guided by his private <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> it will hardly be poſſible to acquit our <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of the guilt of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Nor doth it ſeem worthy of Chriſt who hath left us a Religion full of <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and not any viſible Judg
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56315:52"/> of them: to have <hi>deſigned</hi> about thoſe any viſible executioners.</q> This premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I argue thus.</p>
               <p>Where there is a liberty of <hi>examining</hi> and judging, there muſt be a freedome of <hi>election</hi> upon ſuch judgment: but the Church of <hi>England, v. g.</hi> in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine alloweth men to <hi>ſearch</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and examine whether her <hi>Doctrine</hi> be agreeable to Scripture or no: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>England</hi> and other Reformed cannot in reaſon and equity perſecute ſuch men as in <hi>foro conſcientiae,</hi> ſhall upon ſuch due <hi>examination</hi> of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſſent from their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>principle</hi> paſs current amongſt us, that every one may <hi>read,</hi> judg and <hi>interpret</hi> Scripture: (which is by us the judg of <hi>Controverſies</hi>) the only rule to guide us to Faith: we are bound to give Liberty of Conſcience to others. Whence one of our own Doctors ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">Our Biſhops who have declared the Doctrine of giving <hi>freedome</hi> of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what every one in their private <hi>judgments,</hi> do of <hi>diſcretion</hi> hold to be moſt conformable to Gods Word:</q> yet they very inconſequently and <hi>diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We confeſs the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all Churches may erre, and for ought we know do erre, and lead into error: and ſuch an <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> guide or ground to rely on, is not proportionable to the nature and <hi>quality</hi> of Faith; which muſt be <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible:</hi> with an internal conſent of the Will, and ſubjection of our underſtandings to <hi>revealed</hi> Truths. Our Senſes may be deluded, but Faith not: for it muſt be more firm and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> than any thing we ſee or <hi>feel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſing then the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fallible: will it not be a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing, to be ſtill exacting of Recuſants, by <hi>rigorous Sequeſtratious, Oaths</hi> and what other penalties they think fit: to leave and forſake the Church and <hi>Faith</hi> which they ſo <hi>groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly</hi> hold to be the <hi>infallible</hi> guide, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> by God himſelf, as the only means to direct them <hi>ſecurely</hi> to <hi>eternal Salvation?</hi> And to yield <hi>exterior</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to our own new moulded Church
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56315:53"/> we all profeſs to be fallible? Or to be forced to embrace a <hi>Doctrine</hi> deduced by fallible <hi>interpretations</hi> out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which <hi>interpretations,</hi> the far greater and learneder part of this very age reject as <hi>Heretical:</hi> and which as ſuch were rejected by almoſt all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> for theſe thouſand years. And which perhaps may ſhortly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by us. We having oft-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that which we cryed up before for <hi>verity:</hi> and the Religion now in vogue not many years ago was cryed down.</p>
               <p>If our Church be not then <hi>infallible,</hi> in what we teach againſt them, but may embrace a lye, for a <hi>divine Truth:</hi> they need not to vindicate and juſtifie their moſt juſt <hi>recuſancy</hi> in refuſing to ſubmit; when we provide them no better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but force them to refuſe due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that infallible <hi>direction</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>divine</hi> Writ to bring them ſecurely to their end. To which the moſt <hi>religious,</hi> the moſt <hi>learned,</hi> and the major part of Chriſtians ever yet thought and ſubmitted too. If I ſhould diſobey the <hi>ſentence</hi> of the Church, upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56315:53"/> what other authority can I more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rely? What <hi>Labyrinths</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſmes</hi> ſhould I fall into? How can we force and draw others to our Churches, if we cannot agree where and how to lay our Foundation? How can we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon and reſtrain others; whom we are ſo far from aſſuring of Truth, as we pretend to be but uncertain of it: and are not able to do ſo much for our ſelves? being liable to change, and no ways certain of our own belief to be the moſt infallible? as our multiplied Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions are pregnant inſtances. What is this but to put certain penalties upon an uncertain Faith? And if our Teachers agree not in all points of Religion: the Diſſenters in controverſie are obliged to allow a <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If we ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Church erred for 900. years till our <hi>Reformation</hi> we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our ſelves from all poſſible <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of true Faith or <hi>Salvation.</hi> And to arrogate to our Selves, or to attribute to private perſons or Paſtors the <hi>all-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining</hi> Spirit; which we deny to the whole Church repreſented in a general Council is abſurd. His preſumption muſt

               <p>Now let us hear what our own <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> acknowledge.

In all the Councils, Synods, writings of any Roman Divines, no ſuch matters are found and allowed; but only ſuch as teach Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>loyalty, humility, obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More Princes have been depoſed by Sectaries in ſixty years, than by Papiſts in ſix hundred years: and that depoſing of Kings is no doctrine nor practice of Catholicks ſhall be proved hereafter: and that others have been more faulty in each of their reſpective Sects in all kind of diſorders at home or abroad, Hiſtory and experience teſtifie. In no Country or City in Chriſtendome but Catholick Religion ever entred by <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>ſuffering:</hi> in no Country of Chriſtendome but other Sects entred by <hi>ſedition, rebellion, diſobedience:</hi> or murdering of great Princes or Perſons; by vaſt deſtruction of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Countries, Kingdomes. As in <hi>France, Holland,</hi> ſeveral States in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56315:68"/> Scotland,</hi> twenty years in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> Conſider what was done againſt <hi>France, Holland,</hi> ſeveral States in <hi>Germany Mary</hi> Queen of Scots; or the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Rebellion.</p>
               <p>In Catholick Religion I find they learn their <hi>duty</hi> towards God cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, without an exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty towards their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: to obey him not for <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</hi> or temporal concerns; but out of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> For no Roman Catholick can be true to his <hi>Religion,</hi> who is not true to his Prince. Whom they obey for Conſcience ſake; whoſe Perſon they love and honour; and whoſe proſperity they always pray for; Though ſtript of their Eſtates or loaden with ſtripes. It is in the power of great ones to make them ſuffer; but not to make them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their Religion tells them that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's</hi> due ought not to be kept from him be he of what religion he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>This is the will of God in Scripture, preached by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and from them derived to us: this doctrine is <hi>inſtilled</hi> in their <hi>Catechiſms;</hi> confirmed by their Sermons and <hi>conferences:</hi> Inſomuch
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56315:68"/> that a Papiſt that is not truly <hi>loyal,</hi> is not truly a Papiſt, if to believe not, what they are taught by the Church, makes a man <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be of it.</p>
               <p>From the Saxons to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, to be a Catholick was never taken as a bar to <hi>loyalty.</hi> Nor doth it ſeem poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a Religion which governed <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with glory ſo many hundred years; can teach a doctrine deſtructive to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or infuſe <hi>Maximes</hi> that will breed <hi>Commotion in the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are ready by Oath in the face of Heaven to profeſs loyalty a <hi>divine</hi> command, and an <hi>indiſpenſable</hi> duty: and any who pretend to know what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick doctrine is; muſt know this to be a part of it. In matters of <hi>fact</hi> their <hi>actions</hi> have given <hi>indubitable</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies even by their Enemies own <hi>Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> If Catholicks had been diſloyal, either the King or his Council; or at leaſt the Stateſ-men under <hi>Cromwel</hi> or the <hi>Rump</hi> muſt know it. They <hi>appeal</hi> to the Council in all <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries againſt the King whether ever any conſtant Catholick was acceſſary or concurred in any deſign againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56315:69"/> They <hi>appeal</hi> and challenge all the black Catalogue of <hi>Cromwells favorites</hi> and the whole Rumpiſts, to diſcover, if they can, any <hi>Papiſt</hi> who concurred in any plot or <hi>action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Catholicks refuſe to go to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches in <hi>reſpect</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> They will far more refuſe for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake to commit <hi>Treaſon;</hi> a ſin of a higher degree; will hardly attempt or conſent to any deſperate act againſt their State and Country: and commit ſuch Crimes as hazard Body and Soul. Nay what other Sectaries will boggle at, If the King ſhould be a <hi>Heathen</hi> and make Laws againſt them; they hold it not lawful to reſiſt, but <hi>peaceably</hi> to endure.</p>
               <p>During the time of the late King of <hi>France,</hi> there was propoſed by an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of Catholick <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> this queſtion or <hi>Probleme:</hi> If it were ſuppoſed the King of <hi>France</hi> became a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and by his Power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to force his Subjects to that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity:</hi> whether they might lawfully according to the Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by arms reſiſt him? to which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56315:69"/> the unanimous conſent of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was, that ſuch a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> would be unlawful: ſince Chriſtian Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no other way of maintaining <hi>Faith</hi> againſt lawful Soveraigns, but <hi>prayers, tears</hi> and <hi>ſufferings.</hi>

               <p>Now in this Chapter I adventure to fight againſt a popular <hi>prejudice,</hi> and the <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of long verted opinions: conſidering the number of my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who ſo loudly and reſolutely charge them with deſtructive <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> to the publick good and <hi>ſafety,</hi> that they ſeem to make it an Article of their Creed: objecting Poſitions of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and diſavowed perſons and words only (when others rebelled indeed, and their Battels were real:) but every mans work will bear a better teſtimony of him than other mens words do againſt him.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56315:73"/>
               <p>I know great difficulties may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by truth and time. And vulgar and very general errors have oft been eaſily detected by <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>unbiaſled</hi> men. Whence to overthrow from the very foundation all ſuch aſperſions; let all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial men conſider, firſt, theſe calumnies proceed originally from enemies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are untruths forged againſt them, and taken upon truſt, what their <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> teach you. For it hath been a courſe often practiſed againſt them, by many of their opponents:</p>
               <p>Firſt to frame Articles of their belief according to their own fancy, or out of private and unapproved Authors; as if they were the true and real Articles of their <hi>Faith.</hi> Who being oft preſſed to juſtifie the accuſations could never do it: or durſt not ſhew their faces in a free or publick conference, about the points in queſtion.</p>
               <p>This way of proceeding is againſt all Law and Equity, to condemn them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you <hi>hear</hi> them. No Judg ſends men to be hanged before they ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and <hi>Sentence</hi> given.</p>
               <p>Secondly, According to the rule of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56315:74"/> reaſon; they themſelves ſhould make the Confeſſion and Profeſſion of their own Faith, and that of others, eſpecially their adverſaries ſhould not take it upon them: For any indifferent Judg would wonder you ſhould have better <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> of their Religion than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All examples and practices of the Primitive Churches mentioned in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories,</hi> the cuſtom was, when any Diſpute did ariſe, concerning the integrity of the Doctrine profeſſed in any particular Church, that Church ſo queſtion'd did always ſet down in writing a Confeſſion of their Faith; and tranſmit it either to the Patriarch or ſome general Council: that ſo the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their belief might be tried by the <hi>touchſtone</hi> of the Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Faith being an <hi>internal conſent</hi> of our will, and ſubjection of our underſtanding to truths <hi>revealed,</hi> in abſolute juſtice none but we our ſelves can make an <hi>authentical</hi> manifeſtation of what paſſeth in our ſouls of that nature. And beſides it being the duty of every
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56315:74"/> Chriſtian, not only to make open <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of his Faith when occaſion requires it, but alſo to make ſuch a profeſſion with all poſſible ſincerity and truth: (for to uſe any falſity or <hi>diſſimulation</hi> in a caſe of this <hi>concern,</hi> were not only to deceive men, but even to belye the holy Ghoſt.) It will neceſſarily follow, firſt, no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made of anothers faith, but by the <hi>confeſſion</hi> of the party himſelf: and ſecondly, that a greater <hi>aſſurance</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given between man and man of <hi>veracity</hi> and ſecret dealing, than when we publickly declare our faith upon any point of Controverſie.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds and theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I preſume, their Antagoniſts will be ſo reaſonable as not to queſtion the truth and reality of their meaning in what they declare concerning their <hi>Tenets</hi> in the points of Allegiance or Doctrine. Here I will ſet them down, ſubmitting to the honour and conſcience of all ſober men, and to any indifferent Judges (who will not retain the animoſity and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of parties) to give <hi>ſentence,</hi> whether they are not conſiſtent with loyalty and the duty of good <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians. v. g.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56315:75"/>
               <p>They hold <hi>CHARLES</hi> the II. is their true and lawful Soveraign. Secondly, that no Power on earth ſhall abſolve them from their natural Allegeance. Are ready by Oath in the face of Heaven to profeſs their loyalty indiſpenſable, from which no power can free them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are bound with their lives and fortunes to defend the ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Majeſty in his juſt Rights againſt all oppoſers whatſoever, <hi>domeſtick</hi> or <hi>forraign.</hi> Fourthly, that Faith is to be kept with all men indifferently and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, whether they be Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, or of any other Religion. And that our engagements, promiſes and contracts cannot lawfully be broken, or diſpenſed with by any power on earth to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of any third Perſon.</p>
               <p>They believe the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> to be of infallible authority, and aſſent to it, as the word of God. They believe the ſacred myſtery of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity;</hi> one eternal, almighty and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, whom only they adore and worſhip, as alone having ſoveraign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all things: to whom only is due from Men and Angels, all <hi>glory,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56315:75"/> ſervice</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> abhorring to give their <hi>CREATORS</hi> honour to any creature whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Whence they ſolemnly profeſs, that by the Prayers they addreſs to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> they intend no more, but to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite their <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> before the throne of God; as we deſire the Pravers of one another here upon earth; not that they hope any thing from them as <hi>original</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof; but from God through <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> our only <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do they believe any <hi>Divinity</hi> or Virtue to be in Images, for which they ought to be worſhipped, as the Gentiles did their Idols. But they retain them with due and decent reſpect in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; as <hi>inſtruments</hi> which we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do often aſſiſt our memories and excite our affections. Pictures may be of good uſe (ſaith our learned <hi>Bacon</hi>) if the <hi>repreſentation</hi> of <hi>divine</hi> ſtories, as well work upon them to contemplate thoſe things, as laſcivious Pictures do <hi>Obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Charity obligeth us no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words of men than what they profeſs to be their own ſenſe: but
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56315:76"/> I never heard or read Images abſolutely to be worſhipped, or Saints abſolutely prayed to.</p>
               <p>They firmly believe that no force of nature or dignity of our beſt works can merit our <hi>juſtification;</hi> but we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>freely</hi> by <hi>grace</hi> through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and though we ſhould, by the Grace of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in a godly life: yet are our hopes of eternal Glory built upon the mercy of God and the merits of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>All other <hi>merits</hi> (according to the ſenſe of that word) ſignifie no more, than actions done by the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of Gods <hi>Grace;</hi> to which it has pleas'd his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to promiſe a reward. A Doctrine ſo ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſenſe of holy Scripture, that nothing is ſo frequently repeated in it, as his <hi>gratious</hi> promiſes to <hi>recompence</hi> with everlaſting Glory the Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Servants. 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Rom. 2. 6, 8, 13, Heb. 6. 10. Luke</hi> 16. 38. thus we believe the merit or <hi>rewardableneſs</hi> of holy living, (both which ſignifie the ſame with us) ariſes not from the value even of our <hi>beſt actions:</hi> but from the grace
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56315:76"/> and bounty of God. And for ourſelves we ſincerely profeſs, when we have done all we are are able, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we are unprofitable ſervants. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</p>
               <p>Theſe they ſincerely and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as in the ſight of God, the <hi>ſearcher</hi> of all hearts, taking the words plainly, without any <hi>equivocation</hi> or mental <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> And now let them that judg ſo <hi>ſeverely,</hi> lay their hands on their hearts, and with the ſame <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> with which they expect to be judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the laſt day: Let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce whether or no their <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> are inconſiſtent with the duty of good Chriſtans, or Subjects, and the peaee and ſafety of Government.</p>
               <p>In Law and Reaſon every man, <hi>à for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> a ſociety of men ought to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med honeſt and juſt, till the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be proved: but nothing hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto appeared to be proved againſt the loyalty of Catholicks: therefore in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and juſtice they ought to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed good Subjects and Neighbours: and it is a meer Calumny to aſperſe them.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56315:77"/>
               <p>That nothing can be proved is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, their accuſers being often preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereunto, were never able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any <hi>particular;</hi> or any proof <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to ſatisfie any rational man: But dwelling in vain, general ſuſpicions, triflings and falſe <hi>preſumptions;</hi> laying to their charge extravagant crimes, that have not the leaſt proof or probability: objecting poſitions of ſome private and diſavowed perſons; the crimes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions of particular men to all the party, to traduce and defame the whole, we aggravate the failings of a few.</p>
               <p>The world knows it were no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>recriminate</hi> in this kind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay them with the ſame dirt.

               <p>1.

               <p>No Roman Catholick can be true to his <hi>Religion,</hi> who is not true to his Prince and Country.

               <p>I anſwer as for the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were it not for ſome incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſions nothing pertaining to the ſubſtance or <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> it would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56315:93"/> generally be admitted. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> which purely concerns the <hi>practical</hi> part of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but what Catholicks will moſt willingly <hi>ſwear</hi> unto. But they that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſider the ſeveral parts of that Oath, ſhall find that ſome of them are <hi>ſpeculative points,</hi> and <hi>general:</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>practical</hi> and particular which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to the actions and demeanour of him that ſwears, of which he is Maſter and conſequently can anſwer for them.</p>
               <p>To all the <hi>propoſitions</hi> of this ſecond ſort relating to the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>allegiance;</hi> there is no Catholick in <hi>England</hi> but will ſwear unto them. But as to the firſt ſort therein contained which involve <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative points</hi> and general notions, and withall controverted by ſeveral learned men, I muſt confeſs I think it would be very hard to excuſe ſuch an <hi>Oath</hi> from raſhneſs and ambiguity.</p>
               <p>I humbly therefore intreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conſider: <hi>An Oath is by which God is invoked as a witneſs to what we affirm.</hi> Three Conditions are required to it, expreſſed by the<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2.</note> Prophet, <hi>jurabis mihi in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56315:94"/> veritate &amp; judicio &amp; juſtitia;</hi> Thou ſhalt ſwear in truth, judgment and juſtice. So that if an Oath be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous or falſe it wants the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>viz.</hi> truth, if uſed <hi>raſhly</hi> without <hi>diſcretion,</hi> good advice, and not of juſt neceſſity, it will be deſtitute of judgment. 3. It muſt be ſincere and conform to the eternal Law of God, leſt it want ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. So that it is a breach of ſolemn Oaths if they be <hi>ambiguous,</hi> entangled, or contradicting one another, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now when we come to ſwear in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the <hi>ſpeculative points</hi> of the Popes Power in depoſing Princes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and authorizing one Prince to invade another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although we ſuppoſe the aſſertion to be true that the Pope hath no ſuch Power; Yet how can they with a ſafe Conſcience ſwear point blanck thereunto? It being a matter of fact, nor in our power to make true or falſe. Secondly, they cannot ſwear that <hi>poſition</hi> of the Popes depoſing power is abſolutely <hi>Heretical:</hi> becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is not evident in Scripture nor condemned by the Church. Any other ill names o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> epithets they will be content
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56315:94"/> to give it. Thirdly, In doing ſo they ſeem to profeſs a Declaration of a point of Faith which a particular Chriſtian cannot preſume to do, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a judg and decider of a point of Faith. Fourthly, They would then by Oath teſtifie that all Popes that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and all Writers that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or maintained ſuch a power even in ſome extraordinary caſes and <hi>emergencies</hi> are to be eſteemed <hi>Hereticks;</hi> which is very raſh for any particular to preſume.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference in ſwearing that I believe ſuch a thing to be true, and ſwearing abſolutely ſuch a thing is true, in the firſt, I ſwear, only to my own Opinion (which any that is ſo perſwaded may lawfully do.) In the ſecond I poſitively <hi>ſwear</hi> to the Truth of the thing. And to do this the greateſt <hi>probability</hi> in the world is not ſufficient to warrant me: for the greateſt probability doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an abſolute certainty without which an <hi>Oath</hi> is raſh.</p>
               <p>Papiſts refuſe the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (as 'tis now worded) framed by one <hi>PERKINS</hi> an Apoſtate Jeſuit, purpoſely mingled with uncertain ſpeculative points
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56315:95"/> ambiguous and difficult to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; to make them fall within the Law of refuſal: charged with expreſſions not pertinent to the ſubſtance or intention of the Oath, or relating truly to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King; nor King <hi>James</hi> ever intended to intangle the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of his Subjects, if he had foreſeen a few unneceſſary words and <hi>expreſſions</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it ſo. Nor would Catholicks as to <hi>Allegiance</hi> (if an Oath were worded a hundred times more ſtrong than this) make the leaſt ſcruple of it.</p>
               <p>This argument I urge no further than to evince in their juſtification that their unwillingneſs to <hi>ſwear,</hi> is no evidence to prove their want of <hi>allegiance,</hi> or any backwardneſs to lay down their lives and fortunes in his Majeſties ſervice: For the <hi>practical</hi> part of the Subjects allegiance is that which only concerns the ſecurity of a Prince, which all Catholicks will gladly ſwear unto. Therefore I hope a true and real tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience (which can have no ill conſequence with it in relation to his Majeſties ſafety) will give <hi>no offence</hi> to them that are over them; nor be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56315:95"/> to hold a rigorous hand upon them. Eſpecially ſeeing theſe threeſcores years ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Oath was firſt eſtabliſhed, it hath been refuſed by Catholicks to be taken upon the ſcore of Conſcience though univerſally taken by others of any dignity conferred upon them in Church or State. Yet no Catholick in <hi>England</hi> of any note or quality that all this time did act contrary to their <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> ſworn unto in the Oath. On the other ſide I could wiſh it were as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to name thoſe amongſt the takers of the Oath, who have ſo <hi>fatally</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them; half the Kingdome being in rebellion contrary to what they had ſworn, to the ruine of the beſt King and the beſt man which perhaps this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ever cauſe to glory in.</p>

               <p>This Oath conſiſts of two parts, the <hi>affirmative,</hi> as that the King is only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head as well in Temporal as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the Negative that no Prince, Prelate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath any <hi>juriſdiction</hi> or ſpiritual Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Negative part of the Oath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a point of their <hi>Faith</hi> wherein not only all ſpiritual authority of the Pope, but of a general Council or We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church is diſclaimed. Is all juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>purely ſpiritual</hi> only in the Kings
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56315:97"/> right? are Princes Paſtors of Souls? hath not a Heathen King the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual right? How could King <hi>James</hi> then call the <hi>Pope Patriarch</hi> of the Weſt? or how can a free general Council o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige Chriſtians, and to which learned Proteſtants, profeſs to ſubmit to as the chiefeſt authority under God?</p>
               <p>And although in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time the <hi>Oaths</hi> were explicated, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>civil</hi> and Kingly authority in cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> was intended) yet this negative clauſe cannot be by ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions eluded. Secondly, An Oath to Catholicks and tender <hi>Conſciences,</hi> is ſo dreadful that they dare not call God to witneſs they ſincerely ſwear the Pope ought not to have any Superiority in <hi>ſpiritual cauſes;</hi> unleſs it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them at the ſame time, and the ſame breath to ſignifie that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of civil and Kingly authority in cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> They tremble to ſwear at words ambiguous but formally contradictory. Thirdly, In the thirty nine Artticles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it is defined that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no juriſdiction in this Kingdome, and theſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56315:97"/> Articles are confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereby it appears their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to require a renuntiation of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick point of Faith, and the Popes being Head of the Weſtern Church. This Act being made ſince the ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if the former were ſo expreſſed as to require an acknowledgement of a <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Supremacy in his Majeſty, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical to the Church-Governours: and if the unfortunate word <hi>Heretical,</hi> and ſpeculative points were left out of the other, no Catholick would refuſe either. And more then this no Proteſtant, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that freely take them can intend by them: an Oath being in it ſelf, a religious affirmation with Gods Seal.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever takes theſe Oaths abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely muſt ſwear to take Almighty God to witneſs as he ſhall anſwer at the dreadful day of Judgment, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Pope hath no Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now this word believe (being in a matter of Religion and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the ſame) can ſignifie nothing but a Chriſtian belief or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56315:98"/> 
                  <hi>Faith:</hi> and imports thus much, I N. N. do ſwear in the preſence of Almighty God that the Pope hath no Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As I believe there is a God in Heaven, or any other Article of Faith: all this is virtually and really comprehended in the word <hi>believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what man of Conſcience, of what Opinion ſoever, that <hi>feareth an Oath</hi> to uſe the Preachers words, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 2. will venture his Soul ſo far as to ſwear all this? are we all of us ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that no <hi>forraign juriſdiction, &amp;c.</hi> or that its <hi>Heretical, &amp;c.</hi> as we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there is a God, Heaven, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo make it a part of, and Article of our Belief, when it is not expreſly nor plainly revealed in Scripture or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Church; and ſo not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our <hi>Belief</hi> or abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our Salvation?</p>
               <p>If you ſay it may be obſcurely delivered in Scripture, then at leaſt the unlearned cannot be able to diſcover it. How then ſhall ſuch dare to ſwear; as in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they do when they take the Oaths that they are revealed and contained in Scripture? when by reaſon of obſcurity
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56315:98"/> they are not certain whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed there or no? Is it not a juſt matter of ſcruple and fear for a timorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſwear a thing not to be which he is not certain of? Secondly,</p>
               <p>May the very <hi>learned</hi> in points not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, or obſcurely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered venture to ſwear that ſuch a thing is not certainly in Scripture, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he himſelf conceives it not there? will he make his private judgment rule of <hi>his Faith</hi> and his Conſcience as he muſt do who makes thoſe propoſitions in the Oaths Articles of his Belief? can it be denied that other men no leſs lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſpute the caſe doubtfully? whence we can neither ſwear to be or not be, becauſe we have no ſufficient certainty <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> concerning them. Though we may uſe ſuch expreſſions as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch; we really think and are fully perſwaded that the Pope hath no power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is moſt raſh and <hi>temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to ſwear poſitively to ſuch <hi>inevident propoſitions</hi> expoſing our ſelves to an eminent peril of taking a falſe Oath and thereby committing a ſin to God.</p>
               <p>'Tis pity ſuch <hi>ſlender evaſions</hi> ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56315:99"/> us, as have been ſcorned by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: 'tis much that a moral Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould more check them, than a clearer light can awe us; as if we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured more the <hi>Genius</hi> of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then we <hi>reverence</hi> the preſence of a God. They had their <hi>perjury</hi>-revenging Gods. Our God hates falſe Oaths as appeared in his ſeverity to <hi>Zedekias</hi> for breaking Covenant with the Babyloniſh Monarch though a <hi>Tyrant</hi> of the firſt magnitude. Were all Subjects duly ſollicitous about the weight of this <hi>bond,</hi> we ſhould be leſs prone to take Oaths and more ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to obſerve them.</p>
               <p>Matter of an <hi>Oath</hi> ought to be plain and obvious to our underſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſcurity and <hi>intricacy:</hi> I muſt know what to ſwear otherwiſe I take Gods name in vain in ſwearing without judgment.

No ſin is ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56315:99"/> followed at the heels with more ſignal judgments then this of perjury, as might be convinced by a million of examples.</p>
               <p>I will now conclude this queſtion with the cenſure of two learned Divines of the Engliſh Church concerning theſe Oaths: the firſt objecting Papiſts ſcruple to take the Oaths.</p>
               <p>Anſwereth ſaying—<q rend="margQuotes">they think it is a Pill which will choak their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if they ſwallow it; or purg them out of their livings if they do not.

By a Proviſo of the Act 25, and 27. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> if any Prieſt committed ſhall ſubmit to the Laws, and take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> they ſhall be freed from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; and not adjudged <hi>Traytors,</hi> if they renounce their Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 2. Suppoſe that in the Apoſtles time a Law had been made by any King or Emperour of a contrary Religion to them: that if any of the ſaid Apoſtles or Prieſts ſhould enter into their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to preach a contrary Doctrine to to the Religion there received, and to exerciſe any of their <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> or Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Functions,</hi> it ſhould be <hi>treaſon,</hi> and under pain of death.</p>
               <p>Would or could the Apoſtles have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed thoſe Laws? or did they obey the Governours of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, when they commanded them to preach no more in the name of <hi>Jeſus

               <p>¶ Fourthly, <hi>It may be demanded why cannot Papiſts come to our Churches?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Unity and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> are two things, one being <hi>internal,</hi> the other <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;</hi> therefore if they ſhould conform, yet they can have no verity, faith or truth but as forced; by which <hi>Religion</hi> is never better'd. Truth and falſhood are like the clay in <hi>Nebuchadonoſors</hi> Image,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56315:103"/> they may cleave, but they will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate. Chriſt's Coat had no <hi>ſeam,</hi> though the Churches <hi>veſture</hi> was of divers colours: whence a learned Father ſaith, <hi>in veſte varietas ſit, ſciſſura non ſit.</hi> The true God hath this attribute, that he is a jealous God, and therefore his worſhip and religion will endure no mixture, or partner.</p>
               <p>¶ Fifthly, <hi>To ſay or object the Popes Supremacy is dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reflects not only upon the honour of Catholicks, but the ſafety of all the Profeſſors of it. They acknowledg the Pope, as Succeſſor to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> is head of the Church, and hath <hi>ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in matters <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> but how this can be offenſive to the Temporalities of Princes is not underſtood by me, nor thoſe great Monarchs that are of his Church, and ſubmit to his authority, and and yet are <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>jealous</hi> of their own power and temporal <hi>Regalities</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes can poſſible be.</p>
               <p>Our graver and more learned Divines diſtinguiſh between the inward power of the <hi>Keys</hi> and the outward <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> by temporal penalties: this they aſſign
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56315:103"/> to the King, in all cauſes and over all perſons: that they reſerve to the Clergy, as neither derived from or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> of the Civil Magiſtrate. And if I rightly underſtand the Religion of the Engliſh Church, although they allow the King to be ſupream Governour of their Church; yet they do not confer any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Office</hi> or Juriſdiction upon him; and conſequently he is one of the Flock, and therefore as ſuch he is ſubject to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. Wherefore if this be not looked on by Proteſtants as <hi>derogatory</hi> to the Kings authority, I hope, by the ſame reaſon Roman Catholicks will not be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for owning the Popes Supreamacy in matters <hi>meerly ſpiritual.</hi> There can be no juſt fear or jealouſie, that ſpiritual ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ſhould ſupplant ſecular obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe the Church-Diſcipline in it ſelf is ſo innocent and paſſive.</p>
               <p>We our ſelves acknowledg a ſpiritual authority in the Biſhops, promiſe a <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nical</hi> obedience to them and not to the King; admit Juriſdiction in their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in their <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> and <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Courts will allow the King no authority at all,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56315:104"/> more than the meaneſt Subject; and ſo do other Sects. Now if a Subject <hi>v. g.</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> may be ſupream in Spirituals, without any derogation to the Prince, may not the Pope with leſs danger and inconvenience be truely called (as King <hi>James</hi> did) the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch or Superintendent of the Weſt?</p>
               <p>For if that power be purely ſpiritual, being of a different nature (as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it cannot in the leaſt degree be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial</hi> to the Kings civil power, but rather oblige thoſe that acknowledg it faithfully to obey the King. Therefore it ought to be no obſtacle to <hi>Toleration;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no Chriſtians or Sect whatſoever ought to be tolerated: for let them be Presbyterians, Independents, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not they depend upon and own a power diſtinct from his Majeſties <hi>Civil</hi> Power? I mean a Power meerly ſpiritual or paſtoral, not ſubordinate to the King, but to which the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he be of your Religion, ought to be ſubject, as no Paſtor but a Sheep, no Teacher but a Hearer, no Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Sacraments but a Receiver. Such a Power all Sects and Religions ſeem to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56315:104"/> own, no Catholick depends on or can own more.</p>
               <p>The ſpirituall <hi>Primacy</hi> of the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor preſerves peace and unity, and is a greater defence to them than many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in ſubduing their minds to <hi>civil</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without ſuch a ſpiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there is no <hi>influence</hi> on the people, all preaching and Laws are but <hi>ſhaking Bulwarks</hi> to ſupport Monarchy. No Kingdom hath been more happy at home, or glorious abroad, than when the Pope was their ſpirituall Father. When ſuch a <hi>Primacy,</hi> purely ſpiritual, was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in <hi>England,</hi> the Church here was never torn in pieces with <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> nor poiſoned with <hi>Hereſies:</hi> the honour and ſafety of our Dominions were far from being prejudiced or invaded.</p>
               <p>It is denied then the owning Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould worſe their condition: ſhall notions convince experience? when a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration it ſelf often gives way to practice? Let's ſummon the Kings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> of Catholick Profeſſion to decide the contrary unanimouſly, and proclaim their people are not rebellious by reaſon of any eccleſiaſtical <hi>dependance</hi> abroad.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:56315:105"/>

               <p>Our Catholick Lords of <hi>England</hi> have in the name of the whole Body made oft <hi>proteſtations</hi> of eternal fidelity to the King, and renouncing all dependance of any forreign power, that can any way be prejudicial to him.

               <p>
                  <hi>But you will object, and ſay, they allow a power in the Pope, to excommunicate Princes, and thence follows a train of</hi> pernicious <hi>conſequences of depoſing, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Subjects againſt him, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Councils are not <hi>infallible</hi> in every point, even in matter of <hi>fact;</hi> and other Conſtitutions (not concerning faith or doctrine) being but human Laws are <hi>changeable</hi> and oft admit <hi>exceptions.</hi>

The <hi>Albigenſian</hi> Hereſie beginning to be ſo numerous, and even dangerous, thoſe Monarches thought themſelves in no worſe a condition for that <hi>decree,</hi> nor did any Catholick King ſince complain or proteſt againſt this Council for it.</p>

Note, the Decrees of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils not received or acknowledged <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> by the Catholick Church are not <hi>obligatory,</hi> but that which is principally to be conſidered is, that in the <hi>Decree</hi> of this <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, it is ordained (not Supream Princes) but <hi>temporales poteſtates &amp; dominos,</hi> which bear Offices in States and Kingdoms, to take Oaths to root out all Hereticks, under the penalty of being denounced to be deprived of their Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet reſerving the right of the ſupream Lord.</p>

               <p>Let not now their Adverſaries be ſo unreaſonable as to quote <hi>Mariana, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> or <hi>Bellar.</hi> or any other private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that may have enlarged the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Popes, to the prejudice of Kings, and then lay their particular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the charge of all. For were this a juſt and fair way of dealing, they could, with as much eaſe, requite them with Text for Text out of <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Knox, Buchanan</hi> and many more, whoſe Opinions are at leaſt as dangerous to the ſafety of Monarchy. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them being only this, whereas the former lodge the depoſing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56315:113"/> power in the Pope only (whoſe perſon is at a ſafe and ſufficient diſtance, at leaſt, from us:) the latter bring the danger home to the doors of Princes, and place it in the people whom they make both judges and parties in the caſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Mariana</hi>'s perſonal fault and his opinion were condemned by a Provincial Council of the ſame Society held at <hi>Paris</hi> 15 16. and that confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ratified by <hi>Claudius Aquaviva,</hi> the General of the Order: and the Doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> in the ſame year declared it an ungodly poſition. Thirdly, <hi>Mariana</hi> was not reſolute in that opinion neither, but handled it problematically. Fourthly, It was not for depoſing of Kings but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants which alters the caſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> 1614. a Book written by <hi>Suarez</hi> againſt the <hi>Oaths,</hi> in which the depoſing power was aſſerted, was by Decree of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt by the publick Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, as containing <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious poſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Armandus, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Front</hi> and <hi>Symond</hi> four chief Jeſuits, were to take order their General ſhould renew a prohibition to teach like Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56315:113"/> and the whole Order after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed them.</p>
               <p>Eight Univerſities, <hi>viz. Paris, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Tholouſe, Poicteirs, Burdeaux, Burges, Reims</hi> and <hi>Caen,</hi> did of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (not expecting a command from the Court) 1626. brand this Doctrine of Pope's depoſing power with titles of impious, <hi>ſeditious,</hi> infamous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Foſsart</hi> of the Society in a publick Act advancing the propoſition, although it was interpreted to extend only to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; by decree of the whole Univerſity of <hi>Caen,</hi> the Propoſition and Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were cenſured impious and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Foſſart</hi> impriſoned and ſentenced, bareheaded to acknowledg the ſaid <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> falſe and contrary to the decrees of Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſilence all impertinent objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this nature, or in any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they <hi>declare</hi> to the whole world, that no private authors (but only the <hi>Deciſions</hi> of lawful general Councils) have any influence upon their Faith or Doctrin in any point whatſoever. Therefore if their adverſaries will conclude any thing againſt them from their own Principles;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56315:114"/> they muſt do it from their own proper uncontradicted confeſſion, or from the Decrees of General Councils, from which they only take the Rule of their Faith.</p>
               <p>The Project of the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> undertaken only by a few male-contents; in juſtice might rather be burned in <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion</hi> with the offenders, than objected perpetually to innocent men, who abhor the fact; and were publickly acquitted thereof, by the King himſelf in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament following. See the Kings Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>That the Catholick Body had no hand in this Treaſon, appears by the quality of the actors, and number of them, being but four Gentlemen. The Catholick Noblemen then were the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Nation; their firſt Marqueſs <hi>viz. Wincheſter:</hi> The firſt Earl, <hi>viz. Arundel:</hi> Their firſt Vicount, <hi>viz. Mountague:</hi> Their firſt Baron, <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergaveny, &amp;c.</hi> Now none of theſe or any chief of the party had any intrigue in the deſign, though all imaginable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry was uſed by the Commons,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56315:114"/> Lords, and Privy Council, and by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> their plotting enemy to bring them in.</p>
               <p>Therefore to call this an <hi>univerſal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> plot is in it ſelf a contradiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no plot can be looked on as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral when no number of the chiefeſt part are intrigued in the deſign. If then ſome four neceſſitous or looſe perſons have been of the Gun-powder Treaſon, to infer thence all other of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are of the ſame ſtamp: Do not all rational men ſee this inference is irrational? That it may be retorted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other profeſſion in <hi>England</hi> in other things? Is it not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and uncharitable to infer from thence an imputation upon all others? Can any one in his right ſenſes accuſe the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous, or drunkards, becauſe ſome of them have been guilty of thoſe crimes?</p>

                  <hi>Stow Chron. p.</hi> 882. noteth by many <hi>factious</hi> people, it was given out, this Treaſon was attempted by conſent of the King of <hi>Spain, French</hi> King and Archduke. <hi>Catesby,</hi> at his Death, ſaid, the plot and practice of this Treaſon was only his, and that others were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56315:115"/> but his aſſiſtants, ſaith <hi>Stow.</hi> And the Council perceived it was practiced by ſome diſcontented Papiſt, <hi>Staw</hi> 879.—many untruths were divulged—ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to have drawn into their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe of their Religion, and other malecontents.</p>
               <p>In all their examinations none elſe were diſcovered though they revealed ſeveral ſecret <hi>particulars,</hi> as is ſeen in their printed confeſſions—they would not have ſpared others, ſeeing they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Confeſſour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garnet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Stow,</hi> Provincial of the Jeſuits, for concealing it in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, was executed.—Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to God his offence, was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry, asked God and the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and beſeeched God to bleſs the King and his iſſue: exhorted all Catholicks not to attempt any Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all ſuch courſes, ſaid he, are utterly againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Faith</hi> and Religion. <hi>Vide Stow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To find out the depth of the plot they left no ſtone unrolled, to ſhew how nice they were. <hi>Sturton</hi> and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56315:115"/> 
                  <hi>Mordent,</hi> two Catholick Lords, were fined becauſe they were abſent from Parliament that day: their circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was ſo great, that the Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a Proteſtant, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for many years, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Captain, he admitted <hi>Piercy</hi> into the Bond of Penſioners. Thus any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader may ſee how improbable or rather impoſſible it was the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>party</hi> to be involved therein.</p>
               <p>Concerning Plots we know it was counted a piece of wit in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time to draw men into ſuch <hi>devices;</hi> and none more excellent than <hi>Burleigh</hi> and <hi>Walſingham:</hi> the firſt of which <hi>Cecil</hi> was ſon to, and ſucceſſor to the others <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretariſhip,</hi> and fomenting of plots then in faſhion. Who hath forgot the plots of <hi>Cromwel</hi> framed in his Cloſet, not only to deſtroy many faithful Cavaliers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to put a luſtre upon his intelligence.</p>
               <p>This Gun-powder Treaſon was a meer device (though acted by the hand of ſome deſperate perſons) as King <hi>James</hi> ſaith in his ſecond Proclamation. <hi>(whereas Thomas Piercy &amp; ſome other confederates being of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56315:116"/> moſt part of deſperate Eſtates, &amp;c.</hi>) Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived &amp; invented by a crafty Stateſ-man; who every one knew hated their profeſſion (to make them odious &amp; ſuſpected in that Nation, and to diſoblige his Majeſty of his promiſes in favour of them) and this his jealouſie increaſed, ſeeing the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Council <hi>Henry</hi> Earl<note place="margin">Wil. Hiſt. in King James, p. 3. p. 190.</note> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> an eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and no friend to the Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And his Majeſties ſpeech then to the two Houſes againſt perſecution of Catholicks, as <hi>Wilſon</hi> noteth, as it may be juſtly thought, conſidering what Polititian ſate at the helm then. Nor was it hard for a Secretary to know turbulent and malitious Spirits, as <hi>Stow</hi> calleth <hi>Catesby</hi> a malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days; and when King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Article concerning Indulgency to Engliſh Catholicks. And that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Archduke minded only their own intereſt, <hi>&amp;c. Vide Stow</hi> 880.</p>
               <p>'Tis argument enough to aſſert this, that if a Stateſman profeſſed in tricks, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and envying Roman Catholicks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the material part, contrived alſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56315:116"/> the reſt: and certainly the miraculous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which diſcovered the Gun-powder Treaſon, will diſcover our Stateſmen to be the author of it. The Letter is this to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> a Roman Catholick.</p>

               <p>Now this Letter could not be written by <hi>Piercy,</hi> as reputed; becauſe firſt, there was little intimacy between the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> as <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſaith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s Patron and only ſupport; he was to be ſacrificed, and all Catholick Lords of his Religion: therefore no Plotter writ this; for here a hundred ſuſpicious things, in the opinion of any fool, would endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the diſcovery. Thirdly, Notice alſo given ſo long before the execution; for the Letter was ſent to <hi>Mounteagle</hi> ten days before the 5. of <hi>November,</hi> as <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon p.</hi> 383. Hiſt. ſaith, the long warning being oppoſite to the deſigne of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator. Fourthly, in their examinations they never confeſſed it, as they did things of higher <hi>ſecrecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the interval was beneficial to a <hi>Machivilian,</hi> it would be more grateful to the Council, to have time to conſider the difficulties, to ruine his enemies and make his vigilance appear. And <hi>Cecil</hi> did not miſs of his aim; for, as <hi>Saunderſon</hi> ſays, he was made Earl for his Service. For the Letter came by his contrivance,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56315:117"/> being, as <hi>Osborn. Prot. Hiſt.</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>a neat device of the Treaſurers.</hi> Nor was he ignorant from time to time of their actions, <hi>Osborne Mem. K. Jam. p.</hi> 360. For <hi>Treſham</hi> and another, who were <hi>Cecil's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, had acceſs to him at midnight, and laſt he ſhould diſcover it he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought to a publick trial, were ſent to the Tower, and never ſeen afterward, leſt they ſhould tell tales. And <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi> might have been taken alive, but <hi>Cecil</hi> feared theſe two would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Story leſs to his advantage. Whence they were not made Priſoners, though they had no weapons but their Swords.</p>
               <p>Beſides many knowing men, Strangers abroad have writ; And Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at home have diſcovered ſince, this to be a purpoſed contrivance: So <hi>Oſſate Letters Livr. 2. Epiſt. 43. Prins Antip. of Prelat. p.</hi> 151. His Majeſty alſo well knew ſome had learned this art in their old Miſtreſs's time. Whence he oft ſaid, the fifth of <hi>November</hi> was <hi>Cecils</hi> holiday; as the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and others have prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to have heard from his own mouth. Therefore the Roman party had no
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56315:118"/> hand in the Treaſon, being but thirteen Laymen, and all thoſe drawn in by their mortal enemy.</p>
               <p>This deſperate attempt ſeemed rather of a private Kindred, or Acquaintance, than of any Religion. <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> were Siſters Children, the two <hi>Graunts</hi> two Brethren; and the elder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarried with <hi>Winters</hi> Siſter; <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Keys</hi> were but Servingmen; the two <hi>Wrights</hi> long time dependers on <hi>Catesby,</hi> and their Siſter married to <hi>Piercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any of theſe were Papiſts, or ſo died, they were not ſo long before; for the true Prieſts and Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> knew them not to be ſuch; they being never <hi>frequenters</hi> of Catholick Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and none of them convicted and known recuſants before; as our Courts witneſs. Papiſts and Prieſts know Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, by uſing Sacraments. Theſe they renounced by publick Writings, and condemned their Enterpriſe for impious malefactors of this helliſh Conſpiracy. The Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> with his Lady and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who diſcloſed it, indeed were known Catholicks.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:56315:118"/>
               <p>No Prieſt or known Catholick, after many ſtrict <hi>examinations, ſearches</hi> and <hi>ſcrutinies,</hi> was either proved or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſuſpected of it: but ſo far freed that the Lords of the Council requeſted, that a Prieſt ſhould be appointed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and aſſure <hi>Faux</hi> (an agent in it) that he was bound in conſcience to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what he could of that Conſpiracy. And Maſter <hi>Thomas Wright,</hi> a learned Prieſt did hereupon come to the Council and offer his beſt Service therein, and had a Warrant to that purpoſe ſubſigned with twelve Privy Counſellors hands: but <hi>Faux</hi> had confeſſed all they could wiſh, before he could come to him.</p>
               <p>So that no man of Conſcience can think but Recuſants rather deſerved favour for their loyalty. Seeing the Arch-Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, all Catholicks deteſted and abhorred it, as appears by their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the King, Parliament, and chief Secretary, printed at that time; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any noted or known Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by any device, be drawn into this matter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were up in tumult with <hi>Catesby</hi> were, by our <hi>Prot. Hiſt. Howes,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:56315:119"/> never full fourſcore; and thoſe made up with ſervants, horſe-boys and houſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendance, as <hi>Saunders</hi> and <hi>Speed</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. For if Prieſts and Recuſants, ſo many thouſands then in <hi>England,</hi> would have entertained it; no man can be ſo malitious and ſimple, to think that there would not have been a greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to take ſuch an action in hand; and the Council could not have been ſo ill-ſighted, but that they would have found ſome other <hi>culpable;</hi> as ſome by all imaginable craft and induſtry endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and deſired.</p>
               <p>But to confirm their innocency, King <hi>James</hi> in his own Declaration ſaith, that <hi>the generality of Catholicks did abhor ſuch a deteſtable Conſpiracy no leſs than himſelf.</hi> And he was ſo kind to Catholicks, the laſt half of his Reign, of which <hi>Wilſon</hi> complains in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Wilſ. <hi>K. of 193.</hi>
                  </note> which was impoſſible he ſhould have been ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, had he not been convinced they never had had any deſign of deſtroying him or his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the King in his ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation 1605. and in his third Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56315:119"/> 1605. when they were all diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; in which Proclamation we plainly ſee the King and Council knew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and partakers of that villanie, yet never taxed any Prieſt or Papiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the King in publick Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did free Catholiks as much as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, when he plainly ſaith (as truth is) <hi>if it had taken effect, Proteſtants and Papiſts ſhould have all gone away and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed together.</hi> The King in his ſecond Proclamation againſt the Conſpiracy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Confederates Men of lewd life, inſolent diſpoſitions and of deſperate eſtates.</p>
               <p>And to demonſtrate from the publick Act their innocency as well Proteſtants, he declares by Proclamation, <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione die 7. Novemb.</hi> 1605. <q rend="margQuotes">We are by good <hi>experience</hi> ſo well perſwaded of the loyalty of diverſe Subjects of the Romiſh Religion, that they do as much abhor this deteſtable conſpiracy as our ſelf, and will be ready to do their beſt endeavours, though with expence of their blood to ſuppreſs all attempters againſt our ſafety and the quiet of our

               <p>Another Petition to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from the Cath. in <hi>Eng.</hi> allowed by the Prieſts, was preſented by Sir <hi>Franc. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Knightly,</hi> which ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged likewiſe for a Diſputation.</p>
               <p>Another to the ſame tenure was then, with the ſame aſſent, ſubſcribed with three and twenty hands of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Catholick Gentry of <hi>England;</hi> and preſented to the chief Secretary of State, potent in thoſe times, in Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and (as Recuſants feared) not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected towards them, though never ſo innocent. And the ſame Recuſants were more than jealous, that this practice of Conſpiracy was no great ſecret to that Secretary, long before divers of them, that were actors in it (by him named Catholicks) were acquainted with it: an invention to entrap thoſe he did not affect. Whence Maſter <hi>Howes</hi> in his Hiſt. makes relation,—A great Proteſtant had more, or not much inferiour knowledg of it, than ſome that were put to death for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it.</p>
               <p>Thus the crimes of a few miſerable wretches, neceſſitous and looſe perſons, are perpetually objected to the innocent,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56315:122"/> and made their guilt (though by none more deteſted than themſelves;) but how unreaſonable and how great a ſoleciſm it is in Chriſtianity, to conclude all guilty of every horrid crime, which ſome few are known to have perpetrated? none but injudicious <hi>furies,</hi> and ſuch as, in ſome meaſure, may deſerve to be ranged in the categories of fools or mad-men, but muſt needs acknowledg. And unleſs we will renounce all charity, juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, we muſt not impute particular mens actions (either of this or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) to Catholick Religion, and for their faults expoſe them to common hatred and violence. For in common ſenſe, if Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks refuſe to go to Church in reſpect of Conſcience, they will far more refuſe Treaſon, to attempt or conſent to any deſperate act againſt our Countrey or State, or commit ſuch ſins as hazard both body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>O but bloody Queen <hi>Mary!</hi> O what cries againſt the days of Queen <hi>Mary!</hi> as if her cruelty were unparallell'd? when it plainly appears, to any impartial inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that more Catholicks have died
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56315:123"/> by Proteſtants, than of them by Papiſts; and that ſince the excluſion of the Pope, there hath been a greater quantity of blood judicially ſpilt among us, on the ſcore of Religion, than from the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Why do we then cry out, like men in the fit of fury, of the bloody Papiſts? Its ſuſpition ſome radicated hatred obfuſcates our intellect; as the Poet ſaith,</p>
               <q>Impedit ira animum, nec poteſt cernere verm.</q>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> put none to death, but by the known Laws eſtabliſhed many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the malefactors were born, and which are ſtill uſed to this day by Proteſtants againſt Hereticks. None were then put to death, but by virtue of antient Laws of Chriſtian Emperours, and Kings of <hi>England:</hi> therefore not the Queen, nor Biſhops, but the Law was cruel: yet the ſaid Laws are ſtill in force, ſtill continue, and were made uſe of ſince the Reformation, by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> to burn Hereticks in their time; as <hi>Stow</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> note. Why did King <hi>James</hi> put <hi>Legat</hi> and <hi>Wightman</hi> to death, but becauſe he religiouſly thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56315:123"/> they ſhould live any longer to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme? why did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1587. hang <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Thacker</hi> at Saint <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury,</hi> for publiſhing <hi>Brown</hi>'s Book, ſaith <hi>Cambden,</hi> which, ſaith <hi>Stow p.</hi> 1174. was written againſt the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>I will not apologize for any extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies done by our predeceſſors in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Reformation. He that will judg, let him lay his hand on his own breaſt, and examine what he would do in this condition. Suppoſe he were of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he thought the whole viſible Church from age to age delivered to his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and ſaw Profeſs'd in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; Suppoſe then the preaching of two or three men, baſe in rank, and taxt in moralities, broaching forth new and dangerous opinions to Church and State obſtinately, and would not be ſilenced by any ſatisfactory means, would he think it then cruelty to put Laws in execution againſt ſuch novelties? the conſequences whereof proved ſeditious and rebellious, as is ſeen in Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>There died of the Reformiſts in the the whole but two hundred ſeventy ſeven;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56315:124"/> as <hi>Baker</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary p.</hi> 467. and <hi>Speed</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary p.</hi> 833. and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Writers record: And were there two hundred of thoſe now living, they would ſuffer for extravagancies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated villanies; as moſt of thoſe did in the voluminous Legend of <hi>Fox,</hi> ſtuffed with <hi>Wicliffians</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (whom <hi>Philip Melancton</hi> and other Proteſtants diſown,) with Tinkers, Coblers, Butchers, Taylors and prating Wives, very few of them put to death on the ſcore of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Records teſtifie.</p>

                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> ſo much ſpoken of were attainted of Treaſon defending the Title to the Lady <hi>Jane.

So <hi>Cranmer</hi> was condemned of Treaſon and arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Lady <hi>Jane.</hi> He was alſo an Inſtrument of divorce to bring <hi>Anna Bullein</hi> to the Kings appetite; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he and <hi>Cromwel</hi> the chief actors for her death, as <hi>p. 3.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56315:124"/> convincing her of the foul fact. Or if there were ſome at that time put to death (for their conſcience only, which can hardly be proved, and that there was no faction, exteriour diſobedience or innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the caſe,) yet they could not be properly Proteſtant Martyrs; becauſe they ſuffered before the thirty nine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles or Church of <hi>England</hi> was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
               <p>Reformed Hiſtorians, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Baker, Speed, &amp;c.</hi> do agree Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was a marvellous good Woman, had many troubles; <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> with a thouſand more, ſet up as buſie as Bees againſt her: when ſhe was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in her Rights, Reformiſts would not receive her as their Queen, but upon condition (as <hi>Suffolke</hi> people) nor aſſiſt her without Indentures, <hi>Stow annal. p.</hi> 1064. nor acknowledg her but upon ſuch and ſuch terms, yet her Right was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable.

               <p>How plain and ſincere her Government was, how free from tricks, and ſuch ſtrains of Policy as were afterward uſed; is manifeſt to all the world; How juſt was ſhe? if ſevere for a time, that ſeverity was neceſſary, not only by the judgment of Parliament, which a little before had enacted the Laws on which ſhe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and before which ſhe acted nothing in that kind, but alſo in reſpect of her own

               <p>That She was withal a merciful Princeſs, is evidenc'd by the compaſſion ſhew'd to ſuch as deſerved not well of her, as the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Cheeke,</hi> to Sir <hi>Edward Mountague,</hi> Lord chief Juſtice, who had ſubſcribed and counſelled her diſinheriting, to Sir <hi>Roger Cholmey,</hi> to the Marqneſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Dudley,</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Gates, &amp;c.</hi> who ſtood attainted, and the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> all obnoxious to her Juſtice, ſhe knew very well, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected her Religion nor Title: they being her priſoners in the Tower, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed them all.</p>
               <p>But for all this the Zealots of her time would not be quieted; they libel againſt the Government of Women; they pick quarrels and murmur at her Marriage: they publiſh invectives and ſcurrilous Pamphlets againſt Religion: yet forbear not to plot and conſpire her deprivation.

And whatſoever civil Laws have been made, by Catholick ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Governours, were but as prudent means to prevent Sedition or Rebellions juſtly apprehended. And though for ſome later ages civil Magiſtrates, in ſome Countries, exerciſe greater ſeverities than anciently were uſed; muſt <hi>England</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the rigideſt of other Countries?</p>
               <p>Neither can our hatred or perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Catholicks be any more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, by the proceedings of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Inquiſitions, than our penal Statutes have been by the Laws of ancient Kings and Emperours againſt Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Inquiſition proceeds according to the rules and forms of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; none is declared an Heretick or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56315:129"/> guilty by any new Law or Oath, made only to the end, that by them men may be entrapped both in Soul, in Body and Eſtate. It was no crime in <hi>England</hi> to be a Roman Catholick before the penal Laws were enacted: but it was a crime to be an Heretick or an Apoſtate, or broacher of new Doctrines, before the ancient Emperors and Kings made penal Laws againſt Hereſie. The Law ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and did not make the crime. As penal Statutes do in <hi>England,</hi> making a crime of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereticks are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Inquiſition, without the teſtimony of many lawful witneſſes, both living and dead: All the ancient Fathers, Councils, and the Chriſtian Church of former ages teſtifie their errors are new and contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. No Rebel was ever more evidently convicted of Rebellion againſt his Prince, then Hereticks are by the Inquiſition of Hereſie againſt God and the old Apoſtolical Church. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks cannot obtain ſo fair a Plea, they are condemned by a new Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not Hereticks, and ſeparate from the ancient Faith.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:56315:130"/>
               <p>Thirdly, The Inquiſition practiceth all imaginary means towards the accuſed to reduce his judgment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Inquiſition it ſelf is permitted in no Kingdome where Hereſie is numerous: nor can it be in juſtice: they ſtrive to keep out Sects and new Opinions in Countries totally of one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. We do not morally blame the very Moors in <hi>Africa</hi> being of one profeſſion for keeping out the Goſpel it ſelf. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> where all fell not from the Papacy, there is not the ſame juſt motive for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, as if it brought an upſtart Religion, never heard of or ſpread over the Nation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Inquiſition medleth not with thoſe who never were Catholicks: but the penal Statutes comprehend them who never were of their Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Inquiſition condemns no Hereticks to death, but only declares their hereſie to the end the faithful may avoid their converſation: its true the Secular power executes the ſentence of death againſt them, notwithſtanding the Inquiſition doth proteſt againſt the rigour, and deſireth that Hereticks may not be puniſhed with death.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:56315:130"/>
               <p>Seventhly, Though the Inquiſition were rigorous and unjuſt (as adverſaries pretend) it is not a blemiſh to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, becauſe, it is not an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice but limited to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> at the inſtance of ſecular Princes, looked upon as a neceſſary means to keep their Subjects in awe of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Neither can the Muthers or Maſſacres in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo much and ſo often exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated in Proteſtant Pamphlets and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits be any pretext of rigour or auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Engliſh Catholicks. What hath an Engliſh Catholick to do with an Iriſh Maſſacre? Can we our ſelves excuſe all the extravagancies by ſome of our natives and party? Doth Catholick Religion either incline him to or teach murther or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? Have they not a ſetled ſenſe of Scripture for loyalty and obedience? Which none can alter without breach of his Catholick Faith? And they are not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56315:131"/> their own interpreters and and judges in points controverted; that's the priviledge of others. I only ſay and wiſh from my ſoul that ſome indiſcreet Zealots had not a greater hand in them than Catholick Religion, whoſe tenets are contrary to cruelty and murther on any pretence whatſoever.</p>

               <p>The word <hi>Adoration,</hi> ſignifieth not only divine honour and worſhip, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>civil.</hi> As may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the Scripture and Fathers. The Proteſtants themſelves grant the different kinds of worſhip and honour ſignified thereby.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Adoratious have many examples and teſtimonies in holy Writ, as the word <hi>adoration</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood diverſly: either to God alone, called <hi>Latria:</hi> or to Angels and Saints, holy men, as ſervants of God, and for love
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56315:137"/> of him called <hi>Dulia.</hi> The third a civil worſhip to men of dignity for ſome <hi>civil</hi> or temporal excellency.</p>
               <p>Theſe three kinds of <hi>adoration, &amp;c.</hi> according to the different applications thereof, cannot be diſtinguiſhed in <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but by circumſtances: And becauſe the corporeal <hi>exhibition</hi> of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior acts of ſubmiſſion and <hi>reverence</hi> is common to all kinds of worſhip; thence they are diſtinguiſhed and diverſified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the intention and will of him that doth perform them. Whence it is not to be wondred that, as the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo Catholicks now following the cuſtome and phraſe of holy Scripture, do uſe alſo the word <hi>adoration</hi> in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner and ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The Doctor grants the <hi>civil adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> though abſurdly he denies the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; Calling that civil worſhip which is teſtified in Scripture to have been done to Angels and holy men. Whence the adoration <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> did to Angels could be only <hi>civil.</hi> Which would be abſurd, becauſe there was not therein any <hi>civil</hi> or temporal reſpect, the motive of their <hi>adoration</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:56315:138"/> being a ſupernatural excellency, including alſo a <hi>ſanctity,</hi> or holineſs; as appears by the example of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s adoration of the Angel; who, beſides his falling proſtrate on the ground, was commanded to do more <hi>reverence; viz.</hi> to put off his ſhooes, becauſe the <hi>place was holy, viz.</hi> in reſpect of the Angels preſence.</p>
               <p>The like is to be ſaid of the examples exhibited by <hi>Abdias</hi> to <hi>Elias,</hi> of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Prophets to <hi>Elizaeus;</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Abdias</hi> was in temporal dignity a greater man and more worthy than <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> the Prophet; yet he fell upon his face before <hi>Elias 3 Kings</hi> 18. acknowledging thereby the ſpiritual excellency of Gods Prophet, and did therein an <hi>act religious.</hi> So the children of the Prophets did the like to <hi>Elizaeus, adoraverunt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be called <hi>civil</hi> only, for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual excellency of Angels, and ſanctity of the Prophets being ſupernatural, doth not import any temporal or civil conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a religious reſpect, becauſe it is exhibited to Angels and Saints as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, for the honour and love of him: ſo as the worſhip reſteth not in them, but hath a ſpicial relation to Almighty God, being yielded to them for his ſake; becauſe they are his Servants; and to the end to honour him in them, which muſt be a religious act. This honour being finally and principally to God, for whoſe ſake they are honoured in reſpect of the participation of the divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and abundance of Grace given them; which is ſo far from diſhonouring, that we do him a ſpecial honour and ſervice therein; for ſeeing he ſaid to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>qui vos recipit me recipit, qui vos ſpernit me ſpernit,</hi> he that receiveth you receiveth me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the honour

               <p>I wiſh the Doctor had ſtudied <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks</hi> better, and not to confound and jumble together the <hi>Notions</hi> of thoſe things, which ought to be diſtinguiſhed, abſtracted or ſevered one from another.

               <p>The very light of nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe may decide this <hi>Controverſie:</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:56315:141"/> touching the honour and diſhonour done to a picture or image of them we hate or affect, reflects upon the perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Yet this man, who prattles much of reaſon and ſenſe, denieth the honour or reſpect given to the image of Chriſt or his Saints doth at all redound to them: nay that it is flat idolatry? What Logick is this? is it the ſame thing to worſhip an image inſtead of God; and to worſhip God himſelf before an image? The Jews, we know, did worſhip God by bowing down before the Ark and Cherubims, and yet they did not worſhip them inſtead of God. Do all of the Engliſh Church commit idolatry entring the Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in revererence to the walls, bowing at the Altar or Name of Jeſus, kneeling at their Communion, to their Parents for Bleſſing? all which may be as truely called, and are, as much a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, or inferiour honour, as any practiſed by the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Doth not he interpret the word of God and the ſecond precept falſely? in charging others with idolatry, for doing the ſelf ſame things which God himſelf commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to do, to whom he
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56315:141"/> gave this Precept? Did not God command <hi>Moſes</hi> to make two Cherubims of Gold in the two ends of the Mercy Seat? <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 18.

               <p>Behold now what a deep Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and terrible Logician the Doctor is, the Papiſts were never ſo much put to their <hi>trumps,</hi> he argueth ſo ſubſtantially (againſt Scripture and againſt charity) his inference you muſt mark well.</p>
               <p>God commanded the making of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after he had given the ſecond Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: therefore Papiſts can make no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but they are Idolaters. <hi>Images</hi> were placed in Gods Temple: therefore Papiſts are Idolaters, in placing Images in their Churches. God commanded to bow down and be proſtrate before the Ark: Therefore Papiſts who kneel in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56315:142"/> the ſight of an Image are <hi>Idolaters.</hi> Are not theſe good conſequences? and yet this is the <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>wildy</hi> club where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this great <hi>Hercules</hi> hopeth to beat down Popery.</p>

To go about to paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize and make Antichriſtian all Chriſtian Predeceſſors of this Nation, and all the Churches of Chriſt for a thouſand years, and ſo by a neceſſary conſequence to be members of perdition.</p>

               <p>Pardon me, good Reader, if thou think

And ſhall it be lawful for a private perſon to condemn and deride, on falſe grounds and ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thoſe duties which the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and major part of Chriſtians ever admitted of? and ſhall ſuch a one be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to preach and print, and others abler and honeſter forbid the Preſs and Pulpit? are we not then partial to our ſelves, and become judges of evil thoughts. <hi>James</hi> 2. 1, 4.</p>

               <p>All men ſhould ſpeak honourably and reverently of Princes and Biſhops, the one being Gods Vicegerents in <hi>temporals,</hi> the other in <hi>ſpirituals,</hi> and Succeſſors to the Apoſtles. Suppoſe ſome Popes have behaved themſelves too <hi>ſevere,</hi> or haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (being Princes as well as Biſhops) it is not ſo ſtrange, all great mean ſhould be <hi>Saints.</hi> But the very name of a <hi>Pope</hi> is a <hi>ſcare-crow</hi> to this man; as if he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56315:144"/> were one of the <hi>ignorant Herd,</hi> credulous to believe any fabulous ſtories pick'd out of Legends (like his own Pamphlet) that have neither <hi>charity,</hi> truth or <hi>civility.</hi> Why cannot he (if he were juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt) rehearſe as well the pious acts and memories of good Popes, where there be twenty to one; famous in approved Authors, and undeniable Hiſtory? but that, like ſome venemous <hi>ſerpent</hi> he loves to ſuck only in <hi>poiſoned places:</hi> To ſpeak of our own days, (as he doth at random, without jugment or ſincerity) what can he ſay againſt the lives and the actions of the laſt three Popes? have not they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly laboured for the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> of all Chriſtian Princes, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and againſt the common enemy? and now in particular uniting the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and aſſiſting them with money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Adverſary of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Is it not then a weakneſs in this man, (worthy to be derided by all the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and wiſer ſort) who would make the world believe Popes are ſo dangerous to Monarchy? What Kings or States com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt them? Are his neighbouring Princes jealous or fearful of his power or
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56315:145"/> encroachments? and cannot more potent Princes and Commonwealths, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, better ſecure themſelves by their own power? Are not Catholicks in all places obliged to ſtand to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, in defence of their Countrey, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope as <hi>effectually</hi> as againſt any other? Have not the Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks long ago in open Parliament decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that the Imperial Crown of England is, and hath been at all times, free from all ſabjection to the Pope?</hi> and provided a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>praemunire,</hi> againſt any abuſes as they thought might happen?</p>
               <p>Look on the Engliſh Catholicks in 88. when the Pope was excited and backed by the power of a great Prince, (Her Title being diſputable) and urged by ſome abuſes, aud continued <hi>ſeverities,</hi> to <hi>excommunication, &amp;c.</hi> Do not our own and forraign Writers notwithſtanding te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, the Catholicks ſtood firmly to their Allegiance? and the moſt learned Prieſts, by an <hi>authentick</hi> Writing, acknowledged the Q. (though excommunicated) to have ſtill the ſame authority as her Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and chearfully offered to hazard their lives in defence of her Dignity and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56315:145"/>
               <p>Suppoſe eight or ten men talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Schools of the depoſing power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt that be the Doctrine of the Church? Did the Church ever approve or teach any ſuch <hi>maxims,</hi> or were they ever tolerated? (as he moſt falſely would have it.) Have not all other, numerous, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men contradicted them? did not all the Univerſities of a great Kingdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch opinions, and their Books to be burnt, by a Decree in the face of the world, by publick Juſtice? did not a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſentence the Depoſing Power as <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> although he were a <hi>Tyrant?</hi> Have any other reformed Churches proceeded ſo far?

               <p>Now to overthrow from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all other aſperſions in this kind. Let all impartial men conſider, firſt thoſe <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> proceed originally from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and grand <hi>animoſities</hi> of parties adverſe.

               <p>How ſtrange a wickedneſs is then the groundleſs cenſuring, ſo highly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, ſo many noble and honourable perſonages, ſo many eminently deſerving ſubjects of his Majeſty? ſo many grave, moſt venerable and moſt ſacred perſonages in the world? What account ſhall ſuch give at the laſt day? what is this leſs than perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? what miſchiefs flow and are apt from ſuch libelling by ſad experience, we have taſted the bitterneſs of the fruit.</p>
               <p>The dreadful ruin of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was brought about by ſuch <hi>furious</hi> ones, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> calleth the <hi>Zealots.</hi> And ſhould they ſtill be countenanced, it unavoidab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringeth incurable diviſions; for there
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56315:147"/> is no certain rule of Juſtice with ſuch perſons. Secondly, It breeds an ill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between our fellow ſubjects, and makes them ill looked upon, which violates <hi>civil unity,</hi> ſo neceſſary for the peace and ſtrength of a Kingdom. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It diſincourages Loyalty, to ſee that after ſuch teſtimonies it may be lawful for any, at pleaſure, to brand them as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors publickly in Print. Fourthly, It tends to excite our Governours, that they are not fit to be endured in any State. Fifthly, It muſt breed <hi>fouds</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private perſons all over <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> 6.

Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>And that which muſt ſanctifie all this ſin, is, the ſeeming intereſt of God and Religion, to hinder the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>Popery.</hi> If it was an untruth they ſpake, it was for Religion; if they did <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:56315:148"/> and revile, it was to preſerve the hearers from errors aud <hi>infection.</hi> If they uſed their reputation to murder love, and make others <hi>odious,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in their ſufferings and afflictions. all this is but for defence of truth. They think all this is a part of Chriſtian <hi>zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a mark of Satans way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> he doth it by dividing, and teaching Chriſtians to form odious thoughts of one another: And when his meaning is to ſave you from heaven and truth; he takes upon him, he is only ſaving you from ſin, or errors or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Church.</p>

               <p>It is then the duty of every ſerious Chriſtian to lay aſide all vain jealouſies, idle ſuſpitions, rude <hi>ſeverities;</hi> (and much more forged calumnies) againſt any perſwaſion whatſoever.

               <p>No moderate man that hath left any room in his breaſt for truth; or charity in his heart; can abet ſuch fierce, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious unchriſtian tempers, (which have appeared of late) which have made and ſtill keep open, our <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> if the ſame ſins are continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, and if after ſuch warning (as the whole world ever ſcarce had the like) we remain ſtill ſelf-conceited, and arrogantly ignorant.

               <p>I ſearched <hi>Evangelical</hi> records; and there was nothing but mildneſs, and ſoft doctrine: I enquired into the <hi>breathings of the Spirit,</hi> and they were all <hi>pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> I wondred from what Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encouragement theſe men deducted their practices.

               <p>Different Opinions in Religion, might conſiſt well enough, with peace and publick ſafety, would men be perſwaded to be modeſt, to keep them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not to fancy their conceits neceſſary to the reſt of mankind; to vex their neighbours, provoke their rulers, diſſettle the government and diſturb the peace for the propagation of them.</p>
               <p>Unity and affection might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amidſt diverſity of opinions; if we do but conſider that errors are infirmities of the underſtanding, and no man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be deceived.

If we were <hi>infallible</hi> and all our opinions were <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties</hi> and <hi>demonſtrations;</hi> we might then have more pretence for our <hi>ſtifneſs,</hi> rigidneſs, and <hi>ſeverities.</hi> But to confeſs the <hi>infirmities</hi> of our own faith and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56315:152"/> and to give no candid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to others in many failings, this is utterly inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>The way indeed may not be broad in reſpect of <hi>practice,</hi> or <hi>ſenſual indulgence:</hi> yet it hath a latitude, in reſpect of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>circumſtantial</hi> opinion.

Where nothing elſe will; theſe win and captivate the Soul. And ſuch conqueſts are more noble and better than either thoſe of arts or arms.</p>
               <p>Now to attain this excellent <hi>Catholick</hi> temper, we are to love virtue in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and S. <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>If any brother hath a wife an Infidel and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to dwell with him, let him not put her away,</hi> what can be ſaid more to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige Chriſtians to charity and meekneſs, to forbear one another, than an injunction of an Apoſtle to live peaceably even with an Infidel?</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:56315:153"/>
               <p>The excellency of chriſtian love is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all gifts and <hi>natural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Cor.</hi> 13. it is the image of God, it is his vital Spirit infuſed into us, and renders us moſt like to our Maker. It is the Spirit of <hi>Angels</hi> and glorified Souls. The <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Inhabitants live and abide in love, ſweetneſs and benignity. Nor is that love confined to the bleſſed and glorified company, but it ſheds it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon the neather world. And they <hi>are miniſtring Spirits for our good, Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They ſo far love us, that they can ſtoop from heaven to ſerve us: for <hi>there is joy at the converſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and conſequently love to converted <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp; care and pity for the reſt of men.</p>
               <p>Love and charity is the <hi>vital</hi> grace of Chriſtian Religion; and though mens underſtandings, are convinced already, that charity is their duty: yet there is too much need to repreſent ſome of the vaſt heap of Injunctions that make it ſo, to incline their wills. I ſhall therefore briefly lay together a few of the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour urgeth it in his command <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. he maketh it a diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56315:153"/> note of his Diſciples, 13. 35. and enjoins them to love their enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 24. And the want of it the reaſon of the curſe pronounced on thoſe on the left hand at the ſolemn judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 41. 42.</p>
               <p>This love and union was ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all Chriſtians by the Apoſtles, that they inculcated nothing more than the neceſſity thereof. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted thereto all the perſecution of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, ſaying, <hi>qui diligit proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum legem implevit, Rom.</hi>

                  </gap>3. 3. and <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 22. reckons it five times over, under the names of <hi>peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs</hi> and <hi>meekneſs, Gal.</hi> 22. 23. He advanceth it above <hi>all gifts and graces, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. above <hi>prophecy and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and knowledge of faith.</hi> And the beloved Diſciple Saint <hi>John</hi> attributes unto it our being <hi>born of God:</hi> And the want of this an evidence of not knowing God, and a ſign of one that abideth in death, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. he calls him a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer <hi>that hates another,</hi> 11. 15. a lyar if he pretend to <hi>love God and loveth not his brother, 1 John</hi> 4. 20. we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kindly affected one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and to be pitiful and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56315:154"/> 
                  <hi>courteous,</hi> 11. 10. S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth to mutual charity above all things, <hi>mutuam charitatem ante omnia, &amp;c. Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and 4. 14.</p>
               <p>This our <hi>charity, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, &amp;c.</hi> ought to extend to all men univerſally without limitation; but eſpecially to all Chriſtians as Chriſtians: becauſe ſuch are the more ſpecial objects. It muſt not be conſined by names and the intereſt of parties or ſects; but ought to reach as far as Chriſtianity it ſelf. To love thoſe that are of our way, humour, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is not charity but ſelf-love: and it is not for Chriſts ſake but our own.</p>
               <p>It is rare to meet with ſerious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who are not ſo deeply engaged in ſome party or other, as to darken their judgments, and pervert their affections as to all the reſt. What company can you come into but all their diſcourſe is to ſtigmatiſe diſſenters? what bitter lyes, what invectives have been raiſed againſt moſt grave, ſolid and ancient Chriſtians? how blindly do they look on all that is good in thoſe that differ from them? how partially do they aggravate the faults of all that are againſt their way?
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56315:154"/> and how ſmall a thing will ſerve their turn to excuſe the faults of their own party? and they think all this is a part of Chriſtian zeal, as if Chriſtians enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a war againſt themſelves. And when all men ſhould know them to be Chriſts Diſciples by <hi>loving one another;</hi> moſt men may perceive (that contrary to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of Chriſtianity) they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make each other odious.</p>
               <p>So that though I ſee never ſo much eagerneſs for an opinion, I ſhall never call that <hi>zeal</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> religion without the conſcience of chriſtian love. Yea though ſuch men ſhould ſacrifice their lives, I ſhould not think them <hi>martyrs:</hi> and in this I have the warrant of the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. though <hi>I give my body to be burned and have not charity it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even thoſe that killed Chriſt and his Apoſtles, did it as a duty, and a part of ſervice of God, <hi>John</hi> 16. but believe it, it is <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> to fall from love; your Souls die, when charity dyeth: that which killeth love and charity; killeth all <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>holineſs.</hi> The <hi>opinions, principles,</hi> ſidings, practices, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56315:155"/> love, deſtroys your Souls. O what a <hi>loathſome ſacrifice</hi> is it to the God of love, if we muſt leave our gift at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar till we are reconciled to our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded brother: what a gift is theirs who are unreconciled to almoſt all Churches of Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p>Young unexperienced Chriſtians are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of <hi>Satans</hi> wiles, thinking when a wrathful enemies heat is kindled in them, (even againſt men of ancient principles) that it is a zeal of Gods exciting ſpirit, and that it is your duty, or that you ſhould be luke-warm in the cauſe of God and truth, if you did it not: when alas! it hath more of wrath than love. The white Devil is a killer of Souls as well as the black.</p>
               <p>And now conſidering the expreſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and injunctions of all the aforeſaid and many other places of holy writ, to this grand duty of Religion: if any can quiet their Conſciences, and yet continue in the contrary <hi>perſecuting</hi> ſpirit and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: they have found a way to eſcape all Laws of God; and may conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves religious, though they live in the works of the fleſh, hatred, variance, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:56315:155"/>
               <p>There was never a more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time to tell men of this great ſin, than when the temptation to it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; when God hath been ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonoured by it; when the world doth ring of it. All Sides and Nations reproach us for it: when the ſenſual and partial are ſo hardened in their ſelfiſhneſs, that no warning can take off the Bias of their Judgments. There is a kind of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſome, which is ſo different from that charity which thinketh no evil: that it thinketh nothing<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> elſe concerning thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them: this is contrary to that charity, which is not <hi>puffed up,</hi> and doth not behave it ſelf <hi>unſeemly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that almighty God hath put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent; we may gather, that as the Seed of the Woman ſhould be at enmity with the Seed of the Serpent; ſo ſhould it be at unity with it ſelf. If even with <hi>Infidels</hi> and Heathens the Servant of God muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 24. How much more is Gods family and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be uſed with love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:56315:156"/>
               <p>There is in many Chriſtians a ſtrange <hi>inequality</hi> of <hi>partiality.</hi> Alas! how often have I heard wiſe, and otherwiſe prudent perſons, cry out againſt <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in others; who in their next diſcourſe have ſhamefully ſhewed it themſelves? making much of their own inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſonings, and vilifying urgent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And being ſo intent on their own cauſe, that they could ſcarce have patience to hear another ſpeak, and when they have heard them, their firſt words ſhew, that they never well weighed the ſtrength of his arguments, but were all the while thinking what to ſay againſt him, or how to go on as they had begun.</p>
               <p>Many an errour is taken up by going too far from others. <q rend="margQuotes">Some giddy and heady Profeſſors (ſaith Doctor <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) have been ſo eager to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they are almoſt run out of their wits; ſo jealous of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, that they are pandors for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; ſo ſcared with the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are afraid of all right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſober Religion; ſo fearful of being over-righteous, by following <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of men, that they fear not to be

               </p>
               <p>And thus mens judgments and practices are depraved by flying indiſcreetly from others; while they think more from whence they go than whether: More favouring the ſeparate zeal of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees than the winning zeal of Chriſt: calling themſelves a godly people, and are but a company of ſuperſtitious Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, or a ſort of melancholy humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, who muſt ſit becauſe their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſtands, or muſt go out of the way becauſe their neighbour goeth in it.</p>
               <p>They that will find out the bottom of any Religion muſt prepare themſelves to carry a ſpirit thoroughly diſcharged of all animoſities, paſſions and falſe apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which corrupt the judgment, and raiſe a miſt upon the moſt reſplendent lights of truth.

               <p>Many Chriſtians are as children toſſed too and ſro, fluctuating 'twixt wind and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: there is no other remedy for ſuch, or ſatisfaction or <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Where is perſecution, but from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill of others? abhorring, and not lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? robbing men of the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſtians, not leaving them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liberty of men and ſubjects, nor to plead for themſelves.

               <p>Is perſecution worthy all the calamitous diviſions in Chriſtendom, and the blood of ſo many thouſands ſhed for conſcience ſake? and enduring the outcries of the impriſoned and baniſhed, and their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Heaven from mens hands, and the leaving ſuch a name upon record to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as is uſually left in Hiſtory on the authors of ſuch ſufferings? beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent regret of mind in the calamities of others, and ſad diviſions and deſtructions of charity which cometh hereupon?</p>

So they that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to force or draw any man to profeſs or act contrary to what his Soul believes are as deeply guilty of the ſame crime.
